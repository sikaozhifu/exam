The school district, he said, was facing a crisis. Its students were overburdened and stressed out, having to cope with too much work and too many demands. In the previous school year, 120 middle and high school students were recommended for mental health assessments and 40 were hospitalized. And on a survey administered by the district, students wrote things like, &quot;I hate going to school,&quot; and &quot;Coming out of 12 years in this district, I have learned one thing: that a grade, a percentage or even a point is to be valued over anything else.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) With his letter, Aderhold inserted West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District into a national discussion about the intense focus on achievement at elite schools, and whether it has gone too far. At follow-up meetings, he urged parents to join him in advocating a &quot;whole child&quot; approach to schooling that respects &quot;social-emotional development&quot; and &quot;deep and meaningful learning&quot; over academics alone. The alternative, he suggested, was to face the prospect of becoming another Palo Alto, California, where outsize stress on teenage students is believed to have contributed to a number of suicides in the last six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) But instead of bringing families together, Aderhold&#39;s letter revealed a divide in the district, which has 9,700 students, and one that broke down roughly along racial lines. On one side are white parents like Catherine Foley, a former president of the Parent-Teacher-Student Association at her daughter&#39;s middle school, who has come to see the district&#39;s increasingly pressured atmosphere as opposed to learning. &quot;My son was in fourth grade and told me, &#39;I&#39;m not going to amount to anything because I have nothing to put on my resume,&#39;&quot; she said. On the other side are parents like Mike Jia, one of the thousands of Asian-American professionals who have moved to the district in the past decade, who said Aderhold&#39;s reforms would amount to a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of his children&#39;s education. &quot;What is happening here reflects a national anti-intellectual trend that will not prepare our children for the future,&quot; Jia said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) About 10 minutes from Princeton and an hour and a half from New York City, West Windsor and Plainsboro have become popular bedroom communities for technology entrepreneurs, researchers and engineers, drawn in large part by the public schools. From the last three graduating classes, 16 seniors were admitted to MIT. It produces Science Olympiad winners, classically trained musicians and students with perfect SAT scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E) The district has become increasingly popular with immigrant families from China, India and Korea. This year, 65 percent of its students are Asian-American, compared with 44 percent in 2007. Many of them are the first in their families born in the United States. They have had a growing influence on the district. Asian-American parents are enthusiastic supporters of the competitive instrumental music program. They have been huge supporters of the district&#39;s advanced mathematics program, which once began in the fourth grade but will now start in the sixth. The change to the program, in which 90 percent of the participating students are Asian-American, is one of Aderhold&#39;s reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F) Asian-American students have been eager participants in a state program that permits them to take summer classes off campus for high school credit, allowing them to maximize the number of honors and Advanced Placement classes they can take, another practice that Aderhold is limiting this school year. With many Asian-American children attending supplementary instructional programs, there is a perception among some white families that the elementary school curriculum is being sped up to accommodate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G) Both Asian-American and white families say the tension between the two groups has grown steadily over the past few years, as the number of Asian families has risen. But the division has become more obvious in recent months as Aderhold has made changes, including no-homework nights, an end to high school midterms and finals, and an initiative that made it easier to participate in the music program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H) Jennifer Lee, professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the Asian American Achievement Paradox, says misunderstanding between first-generation Asian-American parents and those who have been in this country longer are common. What white middle-class parents do not always understand, she said, is how much pressure recent immigrants feel to boost their children into the middle class. &quot;They don&#39;t have the same chances to get their children internships (实习职位) or jobs at law firms,&quot; Lee said. &quot;So what they believe is that their children must excel and beat their white peers in academic settings so they have the same chances to excel later. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I) The issue of the stresses felt by students in elite school districts has gained attention in recent years as schools in places like Newton, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto have reported a number of suicides. West Windsor-Plainsboro has not had a teenage suicide in recent years, but Aderhold, who has worked in the district for seven years and been chief for the last three years, said he had seen troubling signs. In a recent art assignments, a middle school student depicted (描绘) an overburdened child who was being scolded for earning an A, rather than an A+ , on a math exam. In the image, the mother scolds the student with the words, &quot;Shame on you!&quot; Further, he said, the New Jersey Education Department has flagged at least two pieces of writing on state English language assessments in which students expressed suicidal thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J) The survey commissioned by the district found that 68 percent of high school honor and Advanced Placement students reported feeling stressed about school &quot;always or most of the time.&quot; &quot;We need to bring back some balance,&quot; Aderhold said. &quot;You don&#39;t want to wait until it&#39;s too late to do something. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K) Not all public opinion has fallen along racial lines. Karen Sue, the Chinese-American mother of a fifth-grader and an eighth-grader, believes the competition within the district has gotten out of control. Sue, who was born in the United States to immigrant parents, wants her peers to dial it back. &quot;It&#39;s become an arms race, an educational arms race,&quot; she said. &quot;We all want our kids to achieve and be successful. The question is, at what cost?&quot;</p><p>36. Aderhold is limiting the extra classes that students are allowed to take off campus.<br />\r\n37. White and Asian-American parents responded differently to Aderhold&#39;s appeal.<br />\r\n38. Suicidal thoughts have appeared in some students&#39; writings.<br />\r\n39. Aderhold&#39;s reform of the advanced mathematics program will affect Asian-American students most.<br />\r\n40. Aderhold appealed for parents&#39; support in promoting an all-round development of children, instead of focusing only on their academic performance.<br />\r\n41. One Chinese-American parent thinks the competition in the district has gone too far.<br />\r\n42. Immigrant parents believe that academic excellence will allow their children equal chances to succeed in the future.<br />\r\n43. Many businessmen and professionals have moved to West Windsor and Plainsboro because of the public schools there.<br />\r\n44. A number of students in Aderhold&#39;s school district were found to have stress-induced mental health problems.<br />\r\n45. The tension between Asian-American and white families has increased in recent years.</p><p>Living in an urban area with green spaces has a long-lasting positive impact on people&#39;s mental well-being, a study has suggested. UK researchers found moving to a green space had a sustained positive effect, unlike pay rises or promotions, which only provided a short-term boost. Co-author Mathew White, from the University of Exeter, UK, explained that the study showed people living in greener urban areas were displaying fewer signs of depression or anxiety. &quot;There could be a number of reasons,&quot; he said, &quot;for example, people do many things to make themselves happier: they strive for promotion or pay rises, or they get married. But the trouble with those things is that within six months to a year, people are back to their original baseline levels of well-being. So, these things are not sustainable; they don&#39;t make us happy in the long term. We found that for some lottery (彩票) winners who had won more than ￡500,000 the positive effect was definitely there, but after six months to a year, they were back to the baseline.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. White said his team wanted to see whether living in greener urban areas had a lasting positive effect on people&#39;s sense of well-being or whether the effect also disappeared after a period of time. To do this, the team used data from the British Household Panel Survey compiled by the University of Essex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explaining what the data revealed, he said: &quot;What you see is that even after three years, mental health is still better, which is unlike many other things that we think will make us happy.&quot; He observed that people living in green spaces were less stressed, and less stressed people made more sensible decisions and communicated better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a growing body of evidence establishing a link between urban green spaces and a positive impact on human well-being, Dr. White said, &quot;There&#39;s growing interest among public policy officials, but the trouble is who funds it. What we really need at a policy level is to decide where the money will come from to help support good quality local green spaces.&quot;</p><p>46.According to one study, what do green spaces do to people?<br />\r\nA.Improve their work efficiency.<br />\r\nB.Add to their sustained happiness.<br />\r\nC.Help them build a positive attitude towards life.<br />\r\nD.Lessen their concerns about material well-being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>47.What does Dr. White say people usually do to make themselves happier?<br />\r\nA.Earn more money.<br />\r\nB.Settle in an urban area.&nbsp;<br />\r\nC.Gain fame and popularity.<br />\r\nD.Live in a green environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>48.What does Dr. White try to find out about living in a greener urban area?<br />\r\nA.How it affects different people.<br />\r\nB.How strong its positive effect is.&nbsp;<br />\r\nC.How long its positive effect lasts.<br />\r\nD.How it benefits people physically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>49.What did Dr. White&#39;s research reveal about people living in a green environment?<br />\r\nA.Their stress was more apparent than real.<br />\r\nB.Their decisions required less deliberation.<br />\r\nC.Their memories were greatly strengthened.<br />\r\nD.Their communication with others improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>50.According to Dr. White, what should the government do to build more green spaces in cities?<br />\r\nA.Find financial support.&nbsp;<br />\r\nB.Improve urban planning.<br />\r\nC.Involve local residents in the effort.<br />\r\nD.Raise public awareness of the issue.</p><p>our probably know about the Titanic, but it was actually just one of three state-of-the-art (先进的) ocean ships back in the day. The Olympic class ships were built by the Harland &amp;amp; Wolff ship makers in Northern Ireland for the White Star Line company. The Olympic class included the Olympic, the Britannic and the Titanic. What you may not know is that the Titanic wasn&#39;t even the flagship of this class. All in all, the Olympic class ships were marvels of sea engineering, but they seemed cursed to suffer disastrous fates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Olympic launched first in 1910, followed by the Titanic in 1911, and lastly the Britannic in 1914. The ships had nine decks, and White Star Line decided to focus on making them the most luxurious ships on the water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stretching 269.13 meters, the Olympic class ships were wonders of naval technology, and everyone thought that they would continue to be so for quite some time. However, all suffered terrible accidents on the open seas. The Olympic got wrecked before the Titanic did, but it was the only one to survive and maintain a successful career of 24 years. The Titanic was the first to sink after famously hitting a huge iceberg in 1912. Following this disaster, the Britannic hit a naval mine in 1916 and subsequently sank as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each ship was coal-powered by several boilers constantly kept running by exhausted crews below deck. Most recognizable of the ship designs are the ship&#39;s smoke stacks, but the fourth stack was actually just artistic in nature and served no functional purpose. While two of these ships sank, they were all designed with double hulls (船体) believed to make them &quot;unsinkable&quot;, perhaps a mistaken idea that led to the Titanic&#39;s and the Britannic&#39;s tragic end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Olympic suffered two crashes with other ships and went on to serve as a hospital ship and troop transport in World War I. Eventually, she was taken out of service in 1935, ending the era of the luxurious Olympic class ocean liners.</p><p>51.What does the passage say about the three Olympic class ships?<br />\r\nA.They performed marvellously on the sea.<br />\r\nB.They could all break the ice in their way.<br />\r\nC.They all experienced terrible misfortunes.<br />\r\nD.They were models of modern engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>52.What did White Star Line have in mind when it purchased the three ships?<br />\r\nA.Their capacity of sailing across all waters.<br />\r\nB.The utmost comfort passengers could enjoy.<br />\r\nC.Their ability to survive disasters of any kind.<br />\r\nD.The long voyages they were able to undertake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>53.What is said about the fourth stack of the ships?<br />\r\nA.It was a mere piece of decoration.<br />\r\nB.It was the work of a famous artist.&nbsp;<br />\r\nC.It was designed to let out extra smoke.<br />\r\nD.It was easily identifiable from afar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>54.What might have led to the tragic end of the Titanic and the Britannic?<br />\r\nA.Their unscientific designs.<br />\r\nB.Their captains&#39; misjudgment.<br />\r\nC.The assumption that they were built with the latest technology.<br />\r\nD.The belief that they could never sink with a double-layer body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>55.What happened to the ship Olympic in the end?<br />\r\nA.She was used to carry troops.<br />\r\nB.She was sunk in World War I.&nbsp;<br />\r\nC.She was converted into a hospital ship.<br />\r\nD.She was retired after her naval service.</p><p>裸婚(down-to-earth marriage )是一种新的结婚方式，指的是一对恋人没有房子、没有车、不办婚礼、不度蜜月甚至没有婚戒，只领取结婚证（marriage certificate)的结婚方式。这种形式的结婚最低成本只有9元钱。现代年轻人的生活压力较大，而且强调爱情的独立，必须有房再结婚或者大肆操办婚事的传统在年轻一代中被削弱。许多人都相信裸婚是两个人纯粹爱情的见证。</p><p>Suppose a foreign friend of yours is going to visit your hometown，what is the most interestingplace you would like to take him/her to see and why?</p>', '0', '150', 'tom', '2019-04-23 18:07:23', '2019-04-23 18:07:23', 'C|L|F|J|E|G|I|B|K|H|F|C|I|E|B|K|H|D|A|G|B|A|C|D|A|C|B|A|D|D|Down-to-earth Marriage\r\nAs a new way of getting married, down-to-earth marriage means that a couple marries each other by only applying for a marriage certificate without an apartment, a car, a wedding ceremony, a honeymoon, or even a wedding ring. This form of marriage can cost as little as only nine yuan. As young people in modern times live under great pressure and place emphasis on the independence of love, the tradition that &ldquo;an apartment is a must for marriage&rdquo; and &ldquo;wedding ceremony should be held on a grand scale&rdquo; has weakened among the young generation.

UK researchers found moving to a green space had a sustained positive effect, unlike pay rises or promotions, which only provided a short-term boost. Co-author Mathew White, from the University of Exeter, UK, explained that the study showed people living in greener urban areas were displaying fewer signs of depression or anxiety. &quot;There could be a number of reasons,&quot; he said, &quot;for example, people do many things to make themselves happier: they strive for promotion or pay rises, or they get married.

So, these things are not sustainable; they don&#39;t make us happy in the long term.

The school district, he said, was facing a crisis. Its students were overburdened and stressed out, having to cope with too much work and too many demands. In the previous school year, 120 middle and high school students were recommended for mental health assessments and 40 were hospitalized. And on a survey administered by the district, students wrote things like, &quot;I hate going to school,&quot; and &quot;Coming out of 12 years in this district, I have learned one thing: that a grade, a percentage or even a point is to be valued over anything else.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) With his letter, Aderhold inserted West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District into a national discussion about the intense focus on achievement at elite schools, and whether it has gone too far. At follow-up meetings, he urged parents to join him in advocating a &quot;whole child&quot; approach to schooling that respects &quot;social-emotional development&quot; and &quot;deep and meaningful learning&quot; over academics alone. The alternative, he suggested, was to face the prospect of becoming another Palo Alto, California, where outsize stress on teenage students is believed to have contributed to a number of suicides in the last six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) But instead of bringing families together, Aderhold&#39;s letter revealed a divide in the district, which has 9,700 students, and one that broke down roughly along racial lines. On one side are white parents like Catherine Foley, a former president of the Parent-Teacher-Student Association at her daughter&#39;s middle school, who has come to see the district&#39;s increasingly pressured atmosphere as opposed to learning. &quot;My son was in fourth grade and told me, &#39;I&#39;m not going to amount to anything because I have nothing to put on my resume,&#39;&quot; she said. On the other side are parents like Mike Jia, one of the thousands of Asian-American professionals who have moved to the district in the past decade, who said Aderhold&#39;s reforms would amount to a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of his children&#39;s education. &quot;What is happening here reflects a national anti-intellectual trend that will not prepare our children for the future,&quot; Jia said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) About 10 minutes from Princeton and an hour and a half from New York City, West Windsor and Plainsboro have become popular bedroom communities for technology entrepreneurs, researchers and engineers, drawn in large part by the public schools. From the last three graduating classes, 16 seniors were admitted to MIT. It produces Science Olympiad winners, classically trained musicians and students with perfect SAT scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E) The district has become increasingly popular with immigrant families from China, India and Korea. This year, 65 percent of its students are Asian-American, compared with 44 percent in 2007. Many of them are the first in their families born in the United States. They have had a growing influence on the district. Asian-American parents are enthusiastic supporters of the competitive instrumental music program. They have been huge supporters of the district&#39;s advanced mathematics program, which once began in the fourth grade but will now start in the sixth. The change to the program, in which 90 percent of the participating students are Asian-American, is one of Aderhold&#39;s reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F) Asian-American students have been eager participants in a state program that permits them to take summer classes off campus for high school credit, allowing them to maximize the number of honors and Advanced Placement classes they can take, another practice that Aderhold is limiting this school year. With many Asian-American children attending supplementary instructional programs, there is a perception among some white families that the elementary school curriculum is being sped up to accommodate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G) Both Asian-American and white families say the tension between the two groups has grown steadily over the past few years, as the number of Asian families has risen. But the division has become more obvious in recent months as Aderhold has made changes, including no-homework nights, an end to high school midterms and finals, and an initiative that made it easier to participate in the music program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H) Jennifer Lee, professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the Asian American Achievement Paradox, says misunderstanding between first-generation Asian-American parents and those who have been in this country longer are common. What white middle-class parents do not always understand, she said, is how much pressure recent immigrants feel to boost their children into the middle class. &quot;They don&#39;t have the same chances to get their children internships (实习职位) or jobs at law firms,&quot; Lee said. &quot;So what they believe is that their children must excel and beat their white peers in academic settings so they have the same chances to excel later. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I) The issue of the stresses felt by students in elite school districts has gained attention in recent years as schools in places like Newton, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto have reported a number of suicides. West Windsor-Plainsboro has not had a teenage suicide in recent years, but Aderhold, who has worked in the district for seven years and been chief for the last three years, said he had seen troubling signs. In a recent art assignments, a middle school student depicted (描绘) an overburdened child who was being scolded for earning an A, rather than an A+ , on a math exam. In the image, the mother scolds the student with the words, &quot;Shame on you!&quot; Further, he said, the New Jersey Education Department has flagged at least two pieces of writing on state English language assessments in which students expressed suicidal thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J) The survey commissioned by the district found that 68 percent of high school honor and Advanced Placement students reported feeling stressed about school &quot;always or most of the time.&quot; &quot;We need to bring back some balance,&quot; Aderhold said. &quot;You don&#39;t want to wait until it&#39;s too late to do something. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K) Not all public opinion has fallen along racial lines. Karen Sue, the Chinese-American mother of a fifth-grader and an eighth-grader, believes the competition within the district has gotten out of control. Sue, who was born in the United States to immigrant parents, wants her peers to dial it back. &quot;It&#39;s become an arms race, an educational arms race,&quot; she said. &quot;We all want our kids to achieve and be successful.

The school district, he said, was facing a crisis. Its students were overburdened and stressed out, having to cope with too much work and too many demands. In the previous school year, 120 middle and high school students were recommended for mental health assessments and 40 were hospitalized. And on a survey administered by the district, students wrote things like, &quot;I hate going to school,&quot; and &quot;Coming out of 12 years in this district, I have learned one thing: that a grade, a percentage or even a point is to be valued over anything else.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) With his letter, Aderhold inserted West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District into a national discussion about the intense focus on achievement at elite schools, and whether it has gone too far. At follow-up meetings, he urged parents to join him in advocating a &quot;whole child&quot; approach to schooling that respects &quot;social-emotional development&quot; and &quot;deep and meaningful learning&quot; over academics alone. The alternative, he suggested, was to face the prospect of becoming another Palo Alto, California, where outsize stress on teenage students is believed to have contributed to a number of suicides in the last six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) But instead of bringing families together, Aderhold&#39;s letter revealed a divide in the district, which has 9,700 students, and one that broke down roughly along racial lines. On one side are white parents like Catherine Foley, a former president of the Parent-Teacher-Student Association at her daughter&#39;s middle school, who has come to see the district&#39;s increasingly pressured atmosphere as opposed to learning. &quot;My son was in fourth grade and told me, &#39;I&#39;m not going to amount to anything because I have nothing to put on my resume,&#39;&quot; she said. On the other side are parents like Mike Jia, one of the thousands of Asian-American professionals who have moved to the district in the past decade, who said Aderhold&#39;s reforms would amount to a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of his children&#39;s education. &quot;What is happening here reflects a national anti-intellectual trend that will not prepare our children for the future,&quot; Jia said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) About 10 minutes from Princeton and an hour and a half from New York City, West Windsor and Plainsboro have become popular bedroom communities for technology entrepreneurs, researchers and engineers, drawn in large part by the public schools. From the last three graduating classes, 16 seniors were admitted to MIT. It produces Science Olympiad winners, classically trained musicians and students with perfect SAT scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E) The district has become increasingly popular with immigrant families from China, India and Korea. This year, 65 percent of its students are Asian-American, compared with 44 percent in 2007. Many of them are the first in their families born in the United States. They have had a growing influence on the district. Asian-American parents are enthusiastic supporters of the competitive instrumental music program. They have been huge supporters of the district&#39;s advanced mathematics program, which once began in the fourth grade but will now start in the sixth. The change to the program, in which 90 percent of the participating students are Asian-American, is one of Aderhold&#39;s reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F) Asian-American students have been eager participants in a state program that permits them to take summer classes off campus for high school credit, allowing them to maximize the number of honors and Advanced Placement classes they can take, another practice that Aderhold is limiting this school year. With many Asian-American children attending supplementary instructional programs, there is a perception among some white families that the elementary school curriculum is being sped up to accommodate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G) Both Asian-American and white families say the tension between the two groups has grown steadily over the past few years, as the number of Asian families has risen. But the division has become more obvious in recent months as Aderhold has made changes, including no-homework nights, an end to high school midterms and finals, and an initiative that made it easier to participate in the music program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H) Jennifer Lee, professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the Asian American Achievement Paradox, says misunderstanding between first-generation Asian-American parents and those who have been in this country longer are common. What white middle-class parents do not always understand, she said, is how much pressure recent immigrants feel to boost their children into the middle class. &quot;They don&#39;t have the same chances to get their children internships (实习职位) or jobs at law firms,&quot; Lee said. &quot;So what they believe is that their children must excel and beat their white peers in academic settings so they have the same chances to excel later. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I) The issue of the stresses felt by students in elite school districts has gained attention in recent years as schools in places like Newton, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto have reported a number of suicides. West Windsor-Plainsboro has not had a teenage suicide in recent years, but Aderhold, who has worked in the district for seven years and been chief for the last three years, said he had seen troubling signs. In a recent art assignments, a middle school student depicted (描绘) an overburdened child who was being scolded for earning an A, rather than an A+ , on a math exam. In the image, the mother scolds the student with the words, &quot;Shame on you!&quot; Further, he said, the New Jersey Education Department has flagged at least two pieces of writing on state English language assessments in which students expressed suicidal thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J) The survey commissioned by the district found that 68 percent of high school honor and Advanced Placement students reported feeling stressed about school &quot;always or most of the time.&quot; &quot;We need to bring back some balance,&quot; Aderhold said. &quot;You don&#39;t want to wait until it&#39;s too late to do something. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K) Not all public opinion has fallen along racial lines. Karen Sue, the Chinese-American mother of a fifth-grader and an eighth-grader, believes the competition within the district has gotten out of control. Sue, who was born in the United States to immigrant parents, wants her peers to dial it back. &quot;It&#39;s become an arms race, an educational arms race,&quot; she said. &quot;We all want our kids to achieve and be successful. The question is, at what cost?&quot;</p><p>36. Aderhold is limiting the extra classes that students are allowed to take off campus.<br />\r\n37. White and Asian-American parents responded differently to Aderhold&#39;s appeal.<br />\r\n38. Suicidal thoughts have appeared in some students&#39; writings.<br />\r\n39. Aderhold&#39;s reform of the advanced mathematics program will affect Asian-American students most.<br />\r\n40. Aderhold appealed for parents&#39; support in promoting an all-round development of children, instead of focusing only on their academic performance.<br />\r\n41. One Chinese-American parent thinks the competition in the district has gone too far.<br />\r\n42. Immigrant parents believe that academic excellence will allow their children equal chances to succeed in the future.<br />\r\n43. Many businessmen and professionals have moved to West Windsor and Plainsboro because of the public schools there.<br />\r\n44. A number of students in Aderhold&#39;s school district were found to have stress-induced mental health problems.<br />\r\n45. The tension between Asian-American and white families has increased in recent years.</p><p>Living in an urban area with green spaces has a long-lasting positive impact on people&#39;s mental well-being, a study has suggested. UK researchers found moving to a green space had a sustained positive effect, unlike pay rises or promotions, which only provided a short-term boost. Co-author Mathew White, from the University of Exeter, UK, explained that the study showed people living in greener urban areas were displaying fewer signs of depression or anxiety. &quot;There could be a number of reasons,&quot; he said, &quot;for example, people do many things to make themselves happier: they strive for promotion or pay rises, or they get married. But the trouble with those things is that within six months to a year, people are back to their original baseline levels of well-being. So, these things are not sustainable; they don&#39;t make us happy in the long term. We found that for some lottery (彩票) winners who had won more than ￡500,000 the positive effect was definitely there, but after six months to a year, they were back to the baseline.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. White said his team wanted to see whether living in greener urban areas had a lasting positive effect on people&#39;s sense of well-being or whether the effect also disappeared after a period of time. To do this, the team used data from the British Household Panel Survey compiled by the University of Essex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explaining what the data revealed, he said: &quot;What you see is that even after three years, mental health is still better, which is unlike many other things that we think will make us happy.&quot; He observed that people living in green spaces were less stressed, and less stressed people made more sensible decisions and communicated better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a growing body of evidence establishing a link between urban green spaces and a positive impact on human well-being, Dr. White said, &quot;There&#39;s growing interest among public policy officials, but the trouble is who funds it. What we really need at a policy level is to decide where the money will come from to help support good quality local green spaces.&quot;</p><p>46.According to one study, what do green spaces do to people?<br />\r\nA.Improve their work efficiency.<br />\r\nB.Add to their sustained happiness.<br />\r\nC.Help them build a positive attitude towards life.<br />\r\nD.Lessen their concerns about material well-being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>47.What does Dr. White say people usually do to make themselves happier?<br />\r\nA.Earn more money.<br />\r\nB.Settle in an urban area.&nbsp;<br />\r\nC.Gain fame and popularity.<br />\r\nD.Live in a green environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>48.What does Dr. White try to find out about living in a greener urban area?<br />\r\nA.How it affects different people.<br />\r\nB.How strong its positive effect is.&nbsp;<br />\r\nC.How long its positive effect lasts.<br />\r\nD.How it benefits people physically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>49.What did Dr. White&#39;s research reveal about people living in a green environment?<br />\r\nA.Their stress was more apparent than real.<br />\r\nB.Their decisions required less deliberation.<br />\r\nC.Their memories were greatly strengthened.<br />\r\nD.Their communication with others improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>50.According to Dr. White, what should the government do to build more green spaces in cities?<br />\r\nA.Find financial support.&nbsp;<br />\r\nB.Improve urban planning.<br />\r\nC.Involve local residents in the effort.<br />\r\nD.Raise public awareness of the issue.</p><p>our probably know about the Titanic, but it was actually just one of three state-of-the-art (先进的) ocean ships back in the day. The Olympic class ships were built by the Harland &amp;amp; Wolff ship makers in Northern Ireland for the White Star Line company. The Olympic class included the Olympic, the Britannic and the Titanic. What you may not know is that the Titanic wasn&#39;t even the flagship of this class. All in all, the Olympic class ships were marvels of sea engineering, but they seemed cursed to suffer disastrous fates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Olympic launched first in 1910, followed by the Titanic in 1911, and lastly the Britannic in 1914. The ships had nine decks, and White Star Line decided to focus on making them the most luxurious ships on the water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stretching 269.13 meters, the Olympic class ships were wonders of naval technology, and everyone thought that they would continue to be so for quite some time. However, all suffered terrible accidents on the open seas. The Olympic got wrecked before the Titanic did, but it was the only one to survive and maintain a successful career of 24 years. The Titanic was the first to sink after famously hitting a huge iceberg in 1912. Following this disaster, the Britannic hit a naval mine in 1916 and subsequently sank as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each ship was coal-powered by several boilers constantly kept running by exhausted crews below deck. Most recognizable of the ship designs are the ship&#39;s smoke stacks, but the fourth stack was actually just artistic in nature and served no functional purpose. While two of these ships sank, they were all designed with double hulls (船体) believed to make them &quot;unsinkable&quot;, perhaps a mistaken idea that led to the Titanic&#39;s and the Britannic&#39;s tragic end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Olympic suffered two crashes with other ships and went on to serve as a hospital ship and troop transport in World War I. Eventually, she was taken out of service in 1935, ending the era of the luxurious Olympic class ocean liners.</p><p>51.What does the passage say about the three Olympic class ships?<br />\r\nA.They performed marvellously on the sea.<br />\r\nB.They could all break the ice in their way.<br />\r\nC.They all experienced terrible misfortunes.<br />\r\nD.They were models of modern engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>52.What did White Star Line have in mind when it purchased the three ships?<br />\r\nA.Their capacity of sailing across all waters.<br />\r\nB.The utmost comfort passengers could enjoy.<br />\r\nC.Their ability to survive disasters of any kind.<br />\r\nD.The long voyages they were able to undertake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>53.What is said about the fourth stack of the ships?<br />\r\nA.It was a mere piece of decoration.<br />\r\nB.It was the work of a famous artist.&nbsp;<br />\r\nC.It was designed to let out extra smoke.<br />\r\nD.It was easily identifiable from afar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>54.What might have led to the tragic end of the Titanic and the Britannic?<br />\r\nA.Their unscientific designs.<br />\r\nB.Their captains&#39; misjudgment.<br />\r\nC.The assumption that they were built with the latest technology.<br />\r\nD.The belief that they could never sink with a double-layer body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>55.What happened to the ship Olympic in the end?<br />\r\nA.She was used to carry troops.<br />\r\nB.She was sunk in World War I.&nbsp;<br />\r\nC.She was converted into a hospital ship.<br />\r\nD.She was retired after her naval service.</p><p>裸婚(down-to-earth marriage )是一种新的结婚方式，指的是一对恋人没有房子、没有车、不办婚礼、不度蜜月甚至没有婚戒，只领取结婚证（marriage certificate)的结婚方式。这种形式的结婚最低成本只有9元钱。现代年轻人的生活压力较大，而且强调爱情的独立，必须有房再结婚或者大肆操办婚事的传统在年轻一代中被削弱。许多人都相信裸婚是两个人纯粹爱情的见证。</p><p>Suppose a foreign friend of yours is going to visit your hometown，what is the most interestingplace you would like to take him/her to see and why?</p>', '0', '150', 'tom', '2019-03-13 15:18:48', '2019-03-13 15:18:48', 'C|L|F|J|E|G|I|B|K|H|F|C|I|E|B|K|H|D|A|G|B|A|C|D|A|C|B|A|D|D|Down-to-earth Marriage\r\nAs a new way of getting married, down-to-earth marriage means that a couple marries each other by only applying for a marriage certificate without an apartment, a car, a wedding ceremony, a honeymoon, or even a wedding ring.

Co-author Mathew White, from the University of Exeter, UK, explained that the study showed people living in greener urban areas were displaying fewer signs of depression or anxiety. &quot;There could be a number of reasons,&quot; he said, &quot;for example, people do many things to make themselves happier: they strive for promotion or pay rises, or they get married.

The school district, he said, was facing a crisis. Its students were overburdened and stressed out, having to cope with too much work and too many demands. In the previous school year, 120 middle and high school students were recommended for mental health assessments and 40 were hospitalized. And on a survey administered by the district, students wrote things like, &quot;I hate going to school,&quot; and &quot;Coming out of 12 years in this district, I have learned one thing: that a grade, a percentage or even a point is to be valued over anything else.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) With his letter, Aderhold inserted West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District into a national discussion about the intense focus on achievement at elite schools, and whether it has gone too far. At follow-up meetings, he urged parents to join him in advocating a &quot;whole child&quot; approach to schooling that respects &quot;social-emotional development&quot; and &quot;deep and meaningful learning&quot; over academics alone. The alternative, he suggested, was to face the prospect of becoming another Palo Alto, California, where outsize stress on teenage students is believed to have contributed to a number of suicides in the last six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) But instead of bringing families together, Aderhold&#39;s letter revealed a divide in the district, which has 9,700 students, and one that broke down roughly along racial lines. On one side are white parents like Catherine Foley, a former president of the Parent-Teacher-Student Association at her daughter&#39;s middle school, who has come to see the district&#39;s increasingly pressured atmosphere as opposed to learning. &quot;My son was in fourth grade and told me, &#39;I&#39;m not going to amount to anything because I have nothing to put on my resume,&#39;&quot; she said. On the other side are parents like Mike Jia, one of the thousands of Asian-American professionals who have moved to the district in the past decade, who said Aderhold&#39;s reforms would amount to a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of his children&#39;s education. &quot;What is happening here reflects a national anti-intellectual trend that will not prepare our children for the future,&quot; Jia said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) About 10 minutes from Princeton and an hour and a half from New York City, West Windsor and Plainsboro have become popular bedroom communities for technology entrepreneurs, researchers and engineers, drawn in large part by the public schools. From the last three graduating classes, 16 seniors were admitted to MIT. It produces Science Olympiad winners, classically trained musicians and students with perfect SAT scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E) The district has become increasingly popular with immigrant families from China, India and Korea. This year, 65 percent of its students are Asian-American, compared with 44 percent in 2007. Many of them are the first in their families born in the United States. They have had a growing influence on the district. Asian-American parents are enthusiastic supporters of the competitive instrumental music program. They have been huge supporters of the district&#39;s advanced mathematics program, which once began in the fourth grade but will now start in the sixth. The change to the program, in which 90 percent of the participating students are Asian-American, is one of Aderhold&#39;s reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F) Asian-American students have been eager participants in a state program that permits them to take summer classes off campus for high school credit, allowing them to maximize the number of honors and Advanced Placement classes they can take, another practice that Aderhold is limiting this school year. With many Asian-American children attending supplementary instructional programs, there is a perception among some white families that the elementary school curriculum is being sped up to accommodate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G) Both Asian-American and white families say the tension between the two groups has grown steadily over the past few years, as the number of Asian families has risen. But the division has become more obvious in recent months as Aderhold has made changes, including no-homework nights, an end to high school midterms and finals, and an initiative that made it easier to participate in the music program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H) Jennifer Lee, professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the Asian American Achievement Paradox, says misunderstanding between first-generation Asian-American parents and those who have been in this country longer are common. What white middle-class parents do not always understand, she said, is how much pressure recent immigrants feel to boost their children into the middle class. &quot;They don&#39;t have the same chances to get their children internships (实习职位) or jobs at law firms,&quot; Lee said. &quot;So what they believe is that their children must excel and beat their white peers in academic settings so they have the same chances to excel later. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I) The issue of the stresses felt by students in elite school districts has gained attention in recent years as schools in places like Newton, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto have reported a number of suicides. West Windsor-Plainsboro has not had a teenage suicide in recent years, but Aderhold, who has worked in the district for seven years and been chief for the last three years, said he had seen troubling signs. In a recent art assignments, a middle school student depicted (描绘) an overburdened child who was being scolded for earning an A, rather than an A+ , on a math exam. In the image, the mother scolds the student with the words, &quot;Shame on you!&quot; Further, he said, the New Jersey Education Department has flagged at least two pieces of writing on state English language assessments in which students expressed suicidal thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J) The survey commissioned by the district found that 68 percent of high school honor and Advanced Placement students reported feeling stressed about school &quot;always or most of the time.&quot; &quot;We need to bring back some balance,&quot; Aderhold said. &quot;You don&#39;t want to wait until it&#39;s too late to do something. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K) Not all public opinion has fallen along racial lines. Karen Sue, the Chinese-American mother of a fifth-grader and an eighth-grader, believes the competition within the district has gotten out of control. Sue, who was born in the United States to immigrant parents, wants her peers to dial it back. &quot;It&#39;s become an arms race, an educational arms race,&quot; she said. &quot;We all want our kids to achieve and be successful. The question is, at what cost?&quot;</p><p>36. Aderhold is limiting the extra classes that students are allowed to take off campus.<br />\r\n37. White and Asian-American parents responded differently to Aderhold&#39;s appeal.<br />\r\n38. Suicidal thoughts have appeared in some students&#39; writings.<br />\r\n39. Aderhold&#39;s reform of the advanced mathematics program will affect Asian-American students most.<br />\r\n40. Aderhold appealed for parents&#39; support in promoting an all-round development of children, instead of focusing only on their academic performance.<br />\r\n41. One Chinese-American parent thinks the competition in the district has gone too far.<br />\r\n42. Immigrant parents believe that academic excellence will allow their children equal chances to succeed in the future.<br />\r\n43. Many businessmen and professionals have moved to West Windsor and Plainsboro because of the public schools there.<br />\r\n44. A number of students in Aderhold&#39;s school district were found to have stress-induced mental health problems.<br />\r\n45. The tension between Asian-American and white families has increased in recent years.</p><p>Living in an urban area with green spaces has a long-lasting positive impact on people&#39;s mental well-being, a study has suggested.

The school district, he said, was facing a crisis. Its students were overburdened and stressed out, having to cope with too much work and too many demands. In the previous school year, 120 middle and high school students were recommended for mental health assessments and 40 were hospitalized. And on a survey administered by the district, students wrote things like, &quot;I hate going to school,&quot; and &quot;Coming out of 12 years in this district, I have learned one thing: that a grade, a percentage or even a point is to be valued over anything else.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) With his letter, Aderhold inserted West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District into a national discussion about the intense focus on achievement at elite schools, and whether it has gone too far. At follow-up meetings, he urged parents to join him in advocating a &quot;whole child&quot; approach to schooling that respects &quot;social-emotional development&quot; and &quot;deep and meaningful learning&quot; over academics alone. The alternative, he suggested, was to face the prospect of becoming another Palo Alto, California, where outsize stress on teenage students is believed to have contributed to a number of suicides in the last six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) But instead of bringing families together, Aderhold&#39;s letter revealed a divide in the district, which has 9,700 students, and one that broke down roughly along racial lines. On one side are white parents like Catherine Foley, a former president of the Parent-Teacher-Student Association at her daughter&#39;s middle school, who has come to see the district&#39;s increasingly pressured atmosphere as opposed to learning. &quot;My son was in fourth grade and told me, &#39;I&#39;m not going to amount to anything because I have nothing to put on my resume,&#39;&quot; she said. On the other side are parents like Mike Jia, one of the thousands of Asian-American professionals who have moved to the district in the past decade, who said Aderhold&#39;s reforms would amount to a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of his children&#39;s education. &quot;What is happening here reflects a national anti-intellectual trend that will not prepare our children for the future,&quot; Jia said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) About 10 minutes from Princeton and an hour and a half from New York City, West Windsor and Plainsboro have become popular bedroom communities for technology entrepreneurs, researchers and engineers, drawn in large part by the public schools. From the last three graduating classes, 16 seniors were admitted to MIT. It produces Science Olympiad winners, classically trained musicians and students with perfect SAT scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E) The district has become increasingly popular with immigrant families from China, India and Korea. This year, 65 percent of its students are Asian-American, compared with 44 percent in 2007. Many of them are the first in their families born in the United States. They have had a growing influence on the district. Asian-American parents are enthusiastic supporters of the competitive instrumental music program. They have been huge supporters of the district&#39;s advanced mathematics program, which once began in the fourth grade but will now start in the sixth. The change to the program, in which 90 percent of the participating students are Asian-American, is one of Aderhold&#39;s reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F) Asian-American students have been eager participants in a state program that permits them to take summer classes off campus for high school credit, allowing them to maximize the number of honors and Advanced Placement classes they can take, another practice that Aderhold is limiting this school year. With many Asian-American children attending supplementary instructional programs, there is a perception among some white families that the elementary school curriculum is being sped up to accommodate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G) Both Asian-American and white families say the tension between the two groups has grown steadily over the past few years, as the number of Asian families has risen. But the division has become more obvious in recent months as Aderhold has made changes, including no-homework nights, an end to high school midterms and finals, and an initiative that made it easier to participate in the music program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H) Jennifer Lee, professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the Asian American Achievement Paradox, says misunderstanding between first-generation Asian-American parents and those who have been in this country longer are common. What white middle-class parents do not always understand, she said, is how much pressure recent immigrants feel to boost their children into the middle class. &quot;They don&#39;t have the same chances to get their children internships (实习职位) or jobs at law firms,&quot; Lee said. &quot;So what they believe is that their children must excel and beat their white peers in academic settings so they have the same chances to excel later. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I) The issue of the stresses felt by students in elite school districts has gained attention in recent years as schools in places like Newton, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto have reported a number of suicides. West Windsor-Plainsboro has not had a teenage suicide in recent years, but Aderhold, who has worked in the district for seven years and been chief for the last three years, said he had seen troubling signs. In a recent art assignments, a middle school student depicted (描绘) an overburdened child who was being scolded for earning an A, rather than an A+ , on a math exam. In the image, the mother scolds the student with the words, &quot;Shame on you!&quot; Further, he said, the New Jersey Education Department has flagged at least two pieces of writing on state English language assessments in which students expressed suicidal thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J) The survey commissioned by the district found that 68 percent of high school honor and Advanced Placement students reported feeling stressed about school &quot;always or most of the time.&quot; &quot;We need to bring back some balance,&quot; Aderhold said. &quot;You don&#39;t want to wait until it&#39;s too late to do something. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K) Not all public opinion has fallen along racial lines. Karen Sue, the Chinese-American mother of a fifth-grader and an eighth-grader, believes the competition within the district has gotten out of control. Sue, who was born in the United States to immigrant parents, wants her peers to dial it back. &quot;It&#39;s become an arms race, an educational arms race,&quot; she said. &quot;We all want our kids to achieve and be successful. The question is, at what cost?&quot;</p><p>36. Aderhold is limiting the extra classes that students are allowed to take off campus.<br />\r\n37. White and Asian-American parents responded differently to Aderhold&#39;s appeal.<br />\r\n38. Suicidal thoughts have appeared in some students&#39; writings.<br />\r\n39. Aderhold&#39;s reform of the advanced mathematics program will affect Asian-American students most.<br />\r\n40. Aderhold appealed for parents&#39; support in promoting an all-round development of children, instead of focusing only on their academic performance.<br />\r\n41. One Chinese-American parent thinks the competition in the district has gone too far.<br />\r\n42. Immigrant parents believe that academic excellence will allow their children equal chances to succeed in the future.<br />\r\n43. Many businessmen and professionals have moved to West Windsor and Plainsboro because of the public schools there.<br />\r\n44. A number of students in Aderhold&#39;s school district were found to have stress-induced mental health problems.<br />\r\n45. The tension between Asian-American and white families has increased in recent years.</p><p>Living in an urban area with green spaces has a long-lasting positive impact on people&#39;s mental well-being, a study has suggested. UK researchers found moving to a green space had a sustained positive effect, unlike pay rises or promotions, which only provided a short-term boost. Co-author Mathew White, from the University of Exeter, UK, explained that the study showed people living in greener urban areas were displaying fewer signs of depression or anxiety. &quot;There could be a number of reasons,&quot; he said, &quot;for example, people do many things to make themselves happier: they strive for promotion or pay rises, or they get married. But the trouble with those things is that within six months to a year, people are back to their original baseline levels of well-being. So, these things are not sustainable; they don&#39;t make us happy in the long term. We found that for some lottery (彩票) winners who had won more than ￡500,000 the positive effect was definitely there, but after six months to a year, they were back to the baseline.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. White said his team wanted to see whether living in greener urban areas had a lasting positive effect on people&#39;s sense of well-being or whether the effect also disappeared after a period of time. To do this, the team used data from the British Household Panel Survey compiled by the University of Essex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explaining what the data revealed, he said: &quot;What you see is that even after three years, mental health is still better, which is unlike many other things that we think will make us happy.&quot; He observed that people living in green spaces were less stressed, and less stressed people made more sensible decisions and communicated better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a growing body of evidence establishing a link between urban green spaces and a positive impact on human well-being, Dr. White said, &quot;There&#39;s growing interest among public policy officials, but the trouble is who funds it. What we really need at a policy level is to decide where the money will come from to help support good quality local green spaces.&quot;</p><p>46.According to one study, what do green spaces do to people?<br />\r\nA.Improve their work efficiency.<br />\r\nB.Add to their sustained happiness.<br />\r\nC.Help them build a positive attitude towards life.<br />\r\nD.Lessen their concerns about material well-being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>47.What does Dr. White say people usually do to make themselves happier?<br />\r\nA.Earn more money.<br />\r\nB.Settle in an urban area.&nbsp;<br />\r\nC.Gain fame and popularity.<br />\r\nD.Live in a green environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>48.What does Dr. White try to find out about living in a greener urban area?<br />\r\nA.How it affects different people.<br />\r\nB.How strong its positive effect is.&nbsp;<br />\r\nC.How long its positive effect lasts.<br />\r\nD.How it benefits people physically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>49.What did Dr. White&#39;s research reveal about people living in a green environment?<br />\r\nA.Their stress was more apparent than real.<br />\r\nB.Their decisions required less deliberation.<br />\r\nC.Their memories were greatly strengthened.<br />\r\nD.Their communication with others improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>50.According to Dr. White, what should the government do to build more green spaces in cities?<br />\r\nA.Find financial support.&nbsp;<br />\r\nB.Improve urban planning.<br />\r\nC.Involve local residents in the effort.<br />\r\nD.Raise public awareness of the issue.</p><p>our probably know about the Titanic, but it was actually just one of three state-of-the-art (先进的) ocean ships back in the day. The Olympic class ships were built by the Harland &amp;amp; Wolff ship makers in Northern Ireland for the White Star Line company. The Olympic class included the Olympic, the Britannic and the Titanic. What you may not know is that the Titanic wasn&#39;t even the flagship of this class. All in all, the Olympic class ships were marvels of sea engineering, but they seemed cursed to suffer disastrous fates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Olympic launched first in 1910, followed by the Titanic in 1911, and lastly the Britannic in 1914. The ships had nine decks, and White Star Line decided to focus on making them the most luxurious ships on the water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stretching 269.13 meters, the Olympic class ships were wonders of naval technology, and everyone thought that they would continue to be so for quite some time. However, all suffered terrible accidents on the open seas. The Olympic got wrecked before the Titanic did, but it was the only one to survive and maintain a successful career of 24 years. The Titanic was the first to sink after famously hitting a huge iceberg in 1912. Following this disaster, the Britannic hit a naval mine in 1916 and subsequently sank as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each ship was coal-powered by several boilers constantly kept running by exhausted crews below deck. Most recognizable of the ship designs are the ship&#39;s smoke stacks, but the fourth stack was actually just artistic in nature and served no functional purpose. While two of these ships sank, they were all designed with double hulls (船体) believed to make them &quot;unsinkable&quot;, perhaps a mistaken idea that led to the Titanic&#39;s and the Britannic&#39;s tragic end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Olympic suffered two crashes with other ships and went on to serve as a hospital ship and troop transport in World War I. Eventually, she was taken out of service in 1935, ending the era of the luxurious Olympic class ocean liners.</p><p>51.What does the passage say about the three Olympic class ships?<br />\r\nA.They performed marvellously on the sea.<br />\r\nB.They could all break the ice in their way.<br />\r\nC.They all experienced terrible misfortunes.<br />\r\nD.They were models of modern engineering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>52.What did White Star Line have in mind when it purchased the three ships?<br />\r\nA.Their capacity of sailing across all waters.<br />\r\nB.The utmost comfort passengers could enjoy.<br />\r\nC.Their ability to survive disasters of any kind.<br />\r\nD.The long voyages they were able to undertake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>53.What is said about the fourth stack of the ships?<br />\r\nA.It was a mere piece of decoration.<br />\r\nB.It was the work of a famous artist.&nbsp;<br />\r\nC.It was designed to let out extra smoke.<br />\r\nD.It was easily identifiable from afar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>54.What might have led to the tragic end of the Titanic and the Britannic?<br />\r\nA.Their unscientific designs.<br />\r\nB.Their captains&#39; misjudgment.<br />\r\nC.The assumption that they were built with the latest technology.<br />\r\nD.The belief that they could never sink with a double-layer body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>55.What happened to the ship Olympic in the end?<br />\r\nA.She was used to carry troops.<br />\r\nB.She was sunk in World War I.&nbsp;<br />\r\nC.She was converted into a hospital ship.<br />\r\nD.She was retired after her naval service.</p><p>裸婚(down-to-earth marriage )是一种新的结婚方式，指的是一对恋人没有房子、没有车、不办婚礼、不度蜜月甚至没有婚戒，只领取结婚证（marriage certificate)的结婚方式。这种形式的结婚最低成本只有9元钱。现代年轻人的生活压力较大，而且强调爱情的独立，必须有房再结婚或者大肆操办婚事的传统在年轻一代中被削弱。许多人都相信裸婚是两个人纯粹爱情的见证。</p><p>Suppose a foreign friend of yours is going to visit your hometown，what is the most interestingplace you would like to take him/her to see and why?</p>', '0', '150', 'tom', '2019-03-13 15:23:47', '2019-03-13 15:23:47', 'C|L|F|J|E|G|I|B|K|H|F|C|I|E|B|K|H|D|A|G|B|A|C|D|A|C|B|A|D|D|Down-to-earth Marriage\r\nAs a new way of getting married, down-to-earth marriage means that a couple marries each other by only applying for a marriage certificate without an apartment, a car, a wedding ceremony, a honeymoon, or even a wedding ring.

As young people in modern times live under great pressure and place emphasis on the independence of love, the tradition that &ldquo;an apartment is a must for marriage&rdquo; and &ldquo;wedding ceremony should be held on a grand scale&rdquo; has weakened among the young generation.

Co-author Mathew White, from the University of Exeter, UK, explained that the study showed people living in greener urban areas were displaying fewer signs of depression or anxiety. &quot;There could be a number of reasons,&quot; he said, &quot;for example, people do many things to make themselves happier: they strive for promotion or pay rises, or they get married. But the trouble with those things is that within six months to a year, people are back to their original baseline levels of well-being. So, these things are not sustainable; they don&#39;t make us happy in the long term. We found that for some lottery (彩票) winners who had won more than ￡500,000 the positive effect was definitely there, but after six months to a year, they were back to the baseline.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. White said his team wanted to see whether living in greener urban areas had a lasting positive effect on people&#39;s sense of well-being or whether the effect also disappeared after a period of time. To do this, the team used data from the British Household Panel Survey compiled by the University of Essex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explaining what the data revealed, he said: &quot;What you see is that even after three years, mental health is still better, which is unlike many other things that we think will make us happy.&quot; He observed that people living in green spaces were less stressed, and less stressed people made more sensible decisions and communicated better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a growing body of evidence establishing a link between urban green spaces and a positive impact on human well-being, Dr. White said, &quot;There&#39;s growing interest among public policy officials, but the trouble is who funds it.

The school district, he said, was facing a crisis. Its students were overburdened and stressed out, having to cope with too much work and too many demands. In the previous school year, 120 middle and high school students were recommended for mental health assessments and 40 were hospitalized. And on a survey administered by the district, students wrote things like, &quot;I hate going to school,&quot; and &quot;Coming out of 12 years in this district, I have learned one thing: that a grade, a percentage or even a point is to be valued over anything else.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) With his letter, Aderhold inserted West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District into a national discussion about the intense focus on achievement at elite schools, and whether it has gone too far. At follow-up meetings, he urged parents to join him in advocating a &quot;whole child&quot; approach to schooling that respects &quot;social-emotional development&quot; and &quot;deep and meaningful learning&quot; over academics alone. The alternative, he suggested, was to face the prospect of becoming another Palo Alto, California, where outsize stress on teenage students is believed to have contributed to a number of suicides in the last six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) But instead of bringing families together, Aderhold&#39;s letter revealed a divide in the district, which has 9,700 students, and one that broke down roughly along racial lines. On one side are white parents like Catherine Foley, a former president of the Parent-Teacher-Student Association at her daughter&#39;s middle school, who has come to see the district&#39;s increasingly pressured atmosphere as opposed to learning. &quot;My son was in fourth grade and told me, &#39;I&#39;m not going to amount to anything because I have nothing to put on my resume,&#39;&quot; she said. On the other side are parents like Mike Jia, one of the thousands of Asian-American professionals who have moved to the district in the past decade, who said Aderhold&#39;s reforms would amount to a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of his children&#39;s education. &quot;What is happening here reflects a national anti-intellectual trend that will not prepare our children for the future,&quot; Jia said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) About 10 minutes from Princeton and an hour and a half from New York City, West Windsor and Plainsboro have become popular bedroom communities for technology entrepreneurs, researchers and engineers, drawn in large part by the public schools. From the last three graduating classes, 16 seniors were admitted to MIT. It produces Science Olympiad winners, classically trained musicians and students with perfect SAT scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E) The district has become increasingly popular with immigrant families from China, India and Korea. This year, 65 percent of its students are Asian-American, compared with 44 percent in 2007. Many of them are the first in their families born in the United States. They have had a growing influence on the district. Asian-American parents are enthusiastic supporters of the competitive instrumental music program. They have been huge supporters of the district&#39;s advanced mathematics program, which once began in the fourth grade but will now start in the sixth. The change to the program, in which 90 percent of the participating students are Asian-American, is one of Aderhold&#39;s reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F) Asian-American students have been eager participants in a state program that permits them to take summer classes off campus for high school credit, allowing them to maximize the number of honors and Advanced Placement classes they can take, another practice that Aderhold is limiting this school year. With many Asian-American children attending supplementary instructional programs, there is a perception among some white families that the elementary school curriculum is being sped up to accommodate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G) Both Asian-American and white families say the tension between the two groups has grown steadily over the past few years, as the number of Asian families has risen. But the division has become more obvious in recent months as Aderhold has made changes, including no-homework nights, an end to high school midterms and finals, and an initiative that made it easier to participate in the music program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H) Jennifer Lee, professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the Asian American Achievement Paradox, says misunderstanding between first-generation Asian-American parents and those who have been in this country longer are common. What white middle-class parents do not always understand, she said, is how much pressure recent immigrants feel to boost their children into the middle class. &quot;They don&#39;t have the same chances to get their children internships (实习职位) or jobs at law firms,&quot; Lee said. &quot;So what they believe is that their children must excel and beat their white peers in academic settings so they have the same chances to excel later. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I) The issue of the stresses felt by students in elite school districts has gained attention in recent years as schools in places like Newton, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto have reported a number of suicides. West Windsor-Plainsboro has not had a teenage suicide in recent years, but Aderhold, who has worked in the district for seven years and been chief for the last three years, said he had seen troubling signs. In a recent art assignments, a middle school student depicted (描绘) an overburdened child who was being scolded for earning an A, rather than an A+ , on a math exam. In the image, the mother scolds the student with the words, &quot;Shame on you!&quot; Further, he said, the New Jersey Education Department has flagged at least two pieces of writing on state English language assessments in which students expressed suicidal thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J) The survey commissioned by the district found that 68 percent of high school honor and Advanced Placement students reported feeling stressed about school &quot;always or most of the time.&quot; &quot;We need to bring back some balance,&quot; Aderhold said. &quot;You don&#39;t want to wait until it&#39;s too late to do something. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K) Not all public opinion has fallen along racial lines. Karen Sue, the Chinese-American mother of a fifth-grader and an eighth-grader, believes the competition within the district has gotten out of control. Sue, who was born in the United States to immigrant parents, wants her peers to dial it back. &quot;It&#39;s become an arms race, an educational arms race,&quot; she said. &quot;We all want our kids to achieve and be successful. The question is, at what cost?&quot;</p><p>36. Aderhold is limiting the extra classes that students are allowed to take off campus.<br />\r\n37. White and Asian-American parents responded differently to Aderhold&#39;s appeal.<br />\r\n38. Suicidal thoughts have appeared in some students&#39; writings.<br />\r\n39. Aderhold&#39;s reform of the advanced mathematics program will affect Asian-American students most.<br />\r\n40. Aderhold appealed for parents&#39; support in promoting an all-round development of children, instead of focusing only on their academic performance.<br />\r\n41. One Chinese-American parent thinks the competition in the district has gone too far.<br />\r\n42. Immigrant parents believe that academic excellence will allow their children equal chances to succeed in the future.<br />\r\n43. Many businessmen and professionals have moved to West Windsor and Plainsboro because of the public schools there.<br />\r\n44. A number of students in Aderhold&#39;s school district were found to have stress-induced mental health problems.<br />\r\n45. The tension between Asian-American and white families has increased in recent years.</p><p>Living in an urban area with green spaces has a long-lasting positive impact on people&#39;s mental well-being, a study has suggested.

The school district, he said, was facing a crisis. Its students were overburdened and stressed out, having to cope with too much work and too many demands. In the previous school year, 120 middle and high school students were recommended for mental health assessments and 40 were hospitalized. And on a survey administered by the district, students wrote things like, &quot;I hate going to school,&quot; and &quot;Coming out of 12 years in this district, I have learned one thing: that a grade, a percentage or even a point is to be valued over anything else.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) With his letter, Aderhold inserted West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District into a national discussion about the intense focus on achievement at elite schools, and whether it has gone too far. At follow-up meetings, he urged parents to join him in advocating a &quot;whole child&quot; approach to schooling that respects &quot;social-emotional development&quot; and &quot;deep and meaningful learning&quot; over academics alone. The alternative, he suggested, was to face the prospect of becoming another Palo Alto, California, where outsize stress on teenage students is believed to have contributed to a number of suicides in the last six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) But instead of bringing families together, Aderhold&#39;s letter revealed a divide in the district, which has 9,700 students, and one that broke down roughly along racial lines. On one side are white parents like Catherine Foley, a former president of the Parent-Teacher-Student Association at her daughter&#39;s middle school, who has come to see the district&#39;s increasingly pressured atmosphere as opposed to learning. &quot;My son was in fourth grade and told me, &#39;I&#39;m not going to amount to anything because I have nothing to put on my resume,&#39;&quot; she said. On the other side are parents like Mike Jia, one of the thousands of Asian-American professionals who have moved to the district in the past decade, who said Aderhold&#39;s reforms would amount to a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of his children&#39;s education. &quot;What is happening here reflects a national anti-intellectual trend that will not prepare our children for the future,&quot; Jia said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) About 10 minutes from Princeton and an hour and a half from New York City, West Windsor and Plainsboro have become popular bedroom communities for technology entrepreneurs, researchers and engineers, drawn in large part by the public schools. From the last three graduating classes, 16 seniors were admitted to MIT. It produces Science Olympiad winners, classically trained musicians and students with perfect SAT scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E) The district has become increasingly popular with immigrant families from China, India and Korea. This year, 65 percent of its students are Asian-American, compared with 44 percent in 2007. Many of them are the first in their families born in the United States. They have had a growing influence on the district. Asian-American parents are enthusiastic supporters of the competitive instrumental music program. They have been huge supporters of the district&#39;s advanced mathematics program, which once began in the fourth grade but will now start in the sixth. The change to the program, in which 90 percent of the participating students are Asian-American, is one of Aderhold&#39;s reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F) Asian-American students have been eager participants in a state program that permits them to take summer classes off campus for high school credit, allowing them to maximize the number of honors and Advanced Placement classes they can take, another practice that Aderhold is limiting this school year. With many Asian-American children attending supplementary instructional programs, there is a perception among some white families that the elementary school curriculum is being sped up to accommodate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G) Both Asian-American and white families say the tension between the two groups has grown steadily over the past few years, as the number of Asian families has risen. But the division has become more obvious in recent months as Aderhold has made changes, including no-homework nights, an end to high school midterms and finals, and an initiative that made it easier to participate in the music program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H) Jennifer Lee, professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the Asian American Achievement Paradox, says misunderstanding between first-generation Asian-American parents and those who have been in this country longer are common. What white middle-class parents do not always understand, she said, is how much pressure recent immigrants feel to boost their children into the middle class. &quot;They don&#39;t have the same chances to get their children internships (实习职位) or jobs at law firms,&quot; Lee said. &quot;So what they believe is that their children must excel and beat their white peers in academic settings so they have the same chances to excel later. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I) The issue of the stresses felt by students in elite school districts has gained attention in recent years as schools in places like Newton, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto have reported a number of suicides. West Windsor-Plainsboro has not had a teenage suicide in recent years, but Aderhold, who has worked in the district for seven years and been chief for the last three years, said he had seen troubling signs. In a recent art assignments, a middle school student depicted (描绘) an overburdened child who was being scolded for earning an A, rather than an A+ , on a math exam. In the image, the mother scolds the student with the words, &quot;Shame on you!&quot; Further, he said, the New Jersey Education Department has flagged at least two pieces of writing on state English language assessments in which students expressed suicidal thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J) The survey commissioned by the district found that 68 percent of high school honor and Advanced Placement students reported feeling stressed about school &quot;always or most of the time.&quot; &quot;We need to bring back some balance,&quot; Aderhold said. &quot;You don&#39;t want to wait until it&#39;s too late to do something. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K) Not all public opinion has fallen along racial lines. Karen Sue, the Chinese-American mother of a fifth-grader and an eighth-grader, believes the competition within the district has gotten out of control. Sue, who was born in the United States to immigrant parents, wants her peers to dial it back. &quot;It&#39;s become an arms race, an educational arms race,&quot; she said. &quot;We all want our kids to achieve and be successful. The question is, at what cost?&quot;</p><p>36. Aderhold is limiting the extra classes that students are allowed to take off campus.<br />\r\n37. White and Asian-American parents responded differently to Aderhold&#39;s appeal.<br />\r\n38. Suicidal thoughts have appeared in some students&#39; writings.<br />\r\n39. Aderhold&#39;s reform of the advanced mathematics program will affect Asian-American students most.<br />\r\n40. Aderhold appealed for parents&#39; support in promoting an all-round development of children, instead of focusing only on their academic performance.<br />\r\n41. One Chinese-American parent thinks the competition in the district has gone too far.<br />\r\n42. Immigrant parents believe that academic excellence will allow their children equal chances to succeed in the future.<br />\r\n43. Many businessmen and professionals have moved to West Windsor and Plainsboro because of the public schools there.<br />\r\n44. A number of students in Aderhold&#39;s school district were found to have stress-induced mental health problems.<br />\r\n45. The tension between Asian-American and white families has increased in recent years.</p><p>Living in an urban area with green spaces has a long-lasting positive impact on people&#39;s mental well-being, a study has suggested. UK researchers found moving to a green space had a sustained positive effect, unlike pay rises or promotions, which only provided a short-term boost. Co-author Mathew White, from the University of Exeter, UK, explained that the study showed people living in greener urban areas were displaying fewer signs of depression or anxiety. &quot;There could be a number of reasons,&quot; he said, &quot;for example, people do many things to make themselves happier: they strive for promotion or pay rises, or they get married. But the trouble with those things is that within six months to a year, people are back to their original baseline levels of well-being. So, these things are not sustainable; they don&#39;t make us happy in the long term. We found that for some lottery (彩票) winners who had won more than ￡500,000 the positive effect was definitely there, but after six months to a year, they were back to the baseline.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. White said his team wanted to see whether living in greener urban areas had a lasting positive effect on people&#39;s sense of well-being or whether the effect also disappeared after a period of time. To do this, the team used data from the British Household Panel Survey compiled by the University of Essex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explaining what the data revealed, he said: &quot;What you see is that even after three years, mental health is still better, which is unlike many other things that we think will make us happy.&quot; He observed that people living in green spaces were less stressed, and less stressed people made more sensible decisions and communicated better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a growing body of evidence establishing a link between urban green spaces and a positive impact on human well-being, Dr. White said, &quot;There&#39;s growing interest among public policy officials, but the trouble is who funds it.

The Olympic class ships were built by the Harland &amp;amp; Wolff ship makers in Northern Ireland for the White Star Line company. The Olympic class included the Olympic, the Britannic and the Titanic. What you may not know is that the Titanic wasn&#39;t even the flagship of this class. All in all, the Olympic class ships were marvels of sea engineering, but they seemed cursed to suffer disastrous fates.</p>\n\n<p>The Olympic launched first in 1910, followed by the Titanic in 1911, and lastly the Britannic in 1914. The ships had nine decks, and White Star Line decided to focus on making them the most luxurious ships on the water.</p>\n\n<p>Stretching 269.13 meters, the Olympic class ships were wonders of naval technology, and everyone thought that they would continue to be so for quite some time. However, all suffered terrible accidents on the open seas. The Olympic got wrecked before the Titanic did, but it was the only one to survive and maintain a successful career of 24 years. The Titanic was the first to sink after famously hitting a huge iceberg in 1912. Following this disaster, the Britannic hit a naval mine in 1916 and subsequently sank as well.</p>\n\n<p>Each ship was coal-powered by several boilers constantly kept running by exhausted crews below deck. Most recognizable of the ship designs are the ship&#39;s smoke stacks, but the fourth stack was actually just artistic in nature and served no functional purpose. While two of these ships sank, they were all designed with double hulls (船体) believed to make them &quot;unsinkable&quot;, perhaps a mistaken idea that led to the Titanic&#39;s and the Britannic&#39;s tragic end.</p>\n\n<p>The Olympic suffered two crashes with other ships and went on to serve as a hospital ship and troop transport in World War I. Eventually, she was taken out of service in 1935, ending the era of the luxurious Olympic class ocean liners.</p><p>51.What does the passage say about the three Olympic class ships?<br />\nA.They performed marvellously on the sea.<br />\nB.They could all break the ice in their way.<br />\nC.They all experienced terrible misfortunes.<br />\nD.They were models of modern engineering.</p>\n\n<p>52.What did White Star Line have in mind when it purchased the three ships?<br />\nA.Their capacity of sailing across all waters.<br />\nB.The utmost comfort passengers could enjoy.<br />\nC.Their ability to survive disasters of any kind.<br />\nD.The long voyages they were able to undertake.</p>\n\n<p>53.What is said about the fourth stack of the ships?<br />\nA.It was a mere piece of decoration.<br />\nB.It was the work of a famous artist.&nbsp;<br />\nC.It was designed to let out extra smoke.<br />\nD.It was easily identifiable from afar.</p>\n\n<p>54.What might have led to the tragic end of the Titanic and the Britannic?<br />\nA.Their unscientific designs.<br />\nB.Their captains&#39; misjudgment.<br />\nC.The assumption that they were built with the latest technology.<br />\nD.The belief that they could never sink with a double-layer body.</p>\n\n<p>55.What happened to the ship Olympic in the end?<br />\nA.She was used to carry troops.<br />\nB.She was sunk in World War I.&nbsp;<br />\nC.She was converted into a hospital ship.<br />\nD.She was retired after her naval service.</p><p>裸婚(down-to-earth marriage )是一种新的结婚方式，指的是一对恋人没有房子、没有车、不办婚礼、不度蜜月甚至没有婚戒，只领取结婚证（marriage certificate)的结婚方式。这种形式的结婚最低成本只有9元钱。现代年轻人的生活压力较大，而且强调爱情的独立，必须有房再结婚或者大肆操办婚事的传统在年轻一代中被削弱。许多人都相信裸婚是两个人纯粹爱情的见证。</p><p>Suppose a foreign friend of yours is going to visit your hometown，what is the most interestingplace you would like to take him/her to see and why?</p>', '0', '150', 'jack', '2019-03-20 20:54:36', '2019-03-20 20:54:36', 'C|L|F|J|E|G|I|B|K|H|F|C|I|E|B|K|H|D|A|G|B|A|C|D|A|<p>C|B|A|D|D</p>|<p>Down-to-earth Marriage<br />\nAs a new way of getting married, down-to-earth marriage means that a couple marries each other by only applying for a marriage certificate without an apartment, a car, a wedding ceremony, a honeymoon, or even a wedding ring.

The school district, he said, was facing a crisis. Its students were overburdened and stressed out, having to cope with too much work and too many demands. In the previous school year, 120 middle and high school students were recommended for mental health assessments and 40 were hospitalized. And on a survey administered by the district, students wrote things like, &quot;I hate going to school,&quot; and &quot;Coming out of 12 years in this district, I have learned one thing: that a grade, a percentage or even a point is to be valued over anything else.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) With his letter, Aderhold inserted West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District into a national discussion about the intense focus on achievement at elite schools, and whether it has gone too far. At follow-up meetings, he urged parents to join him in advocating a &quot;whole child&quot; approach to schooling that respects &quot;social-emotional development&quot; and &quot;deep and meaningful learning&quot; over academics alone. The alternative, he suggested, was to face the prospect of becoming another Palo Alto, California, where outsize stress on teenage students is believed to have contributed to a number of suicides in the last six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) But instead of bringing families together, Aderhold&#39;s letter revealed a divide in the district, which has 9,700 students, and one that broke down roughly along racial lines. On one side are white parents like Catherine Foley, a former president of the Parent-Teacher-Student Association at her daughter&#39;s middle school, who has come to see the district&#39;s increasingly pressured atmosphere as opposed to learning. &quot;My son was in fourth grade and told me, &#39;I&#39;m not going to amount to anything because I have nothing to put on my resume,&#39;&quot; she said. On the other side are parents like Mike Jia, one of the thousands of Asian-American professionals who have moved to the district in the past decade, who said Aderhold&#39;s reforms would amount to a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of his children&#39;s education. &quot;What is happening here reflects a national anti-intellectual trend that will not prepare our children for the future,&quot; Jia said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) About 10 minutes from Princeton and an hour and a half from New York City, West Windsor and Plainsboro have become popular bedroom communities for technology entrepreneurs, researchers and engineers, drawn in large part by the public schools. From the last three graduating classes, 16 seniors were admitted to MIT. It produces Science Olympiad winners, classically trained musicians and students with perfect SAT scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E) The district has become increasingly popular with immigrant families from China, India and Korea. This year, 65 percent of its students are Asian-American, compared with 44 percent in 2007. Many of them are the first in their families born in the United States. They have had a growing influence on the district. Asian-American parents are enthusiastic supporters of the competitive instrumental music program. They have been huge supporters of the district&#39;s advanced mathematics program, which once began in the fourth grade but will now start in the sixth. The change to the program, in which 90 percent of the participating students are Asian-American, is one of Aderhold&#39;s reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F) Asian-American students have been eager participants in a state program that permits them to take summer classes off campus for high school credit, allowing them to maximize the number of honors and Advanced Placement classes they can take, another practice that Aderhold is limiting this school year. With many Asian-American children attending supplementary instructional programs, there is a perception among some white families that the elementary school curriculum is being sped up to accommodate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G) Both Asian-American and white families say the tension between the two groups has grown steadily over the past few years, as the number of Asian families has risen. But the division has become more obvious in recent months as Aderhold has made changes, including no-homework nights, an end to high school midterms and finals, and an initiative that made it easier to participate in the music program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H) Jennifer Lee, professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the Asian American Achievement Paradox, says misunderstanding between first-generation Asian-American parents and those who have been in this country longer are common. What white middle-class parents do not always understand, she said, is how much pressure recent immigrants feel to boost their children into the middle class. &quot;They don&#39;t have the same chances to get their children internships (实习职位) or jobs at law firms,&quot; Lee said. &quot;So what they believe is that their children must excel and beat their white peers in academic settings so they have the same chances to excel later. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I) The issue of the stresses felt by students in elite school districts has gained attention in recent years as schools in places like Newton, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto have reported a number of suicides. West Windsor-Plainsboro has not had a teenage suicide in recent years, but Aderhold, who has worked in the district for seven years and been chief for the last three years, said he had seen troubling signs. In a recent art assignments, a middle school student depicted (描绘) an overburdened child who was being scolded for earning an A, rather than an A+ , on a math exam. In the image, the mother scolds the student with the words, &quot;Shame on you!&quot; Further, he said, the New Jersey Education Department has flagged at least two pieces of writing on state English language assessments in which students expressed suicidal thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J) The survey commissioned by the district found that 68 percent of high school honor and Advanced Placement students reported feeling stressed about school &quot;always or most of the time.&quot; &quot;We need to bring back some balance,&quot; Aderhold said. &quot;You don&#39;t want to wait until it&#39;s too late to do something. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K) Not all public opinion has fallen along racial lines. Karen Sue, the Chinese-American mother of a fifth-grader and an eighth-grader, believes the competition within the district has gotten out of control. Sue, who was born in the United States to immigrant parents, wants her peers to dial it back. &quot;It&#39;s become an arms race, an educational arms race,&quot; she said. &quot;We all want our kids to achieve and be successful. The question is, at what cost?&quot;</p><p>36. Aderhold is limiting the extra classes that students are allowed to take off campus.<br />\r\n37. White and Asian-American parents responded differently to Aderhold&#39;s appeal.<br />\r\n38. Suicidal thoughts have appeared in some students&#39; writings.<br />\r\n39. Aderhold&#39;s reform of the advanced mathematics program will affect Asian-American students most.<br />\r\n40. Aderhold appealed for parents&#39; support in promoting an all-round development of children, instead of focusing only on their academic performance.<br />\r\n41. One Chinese-American parent thinks the competition in the district has gone too far.<br />\r\n42. Immigrant parents believe that academic excellence will allow their children equal chances to succeed in the future.<br />\r\n43. Many businessmen and professionals have moved to West Windsor and Plainsboro because of the public schools there.<br />\r\n44. A number of students in Aderhold&#39;s school district were found to have stress-induced mental health problems.<br />\r\n45. The tension between Asian-American and white families has increased in recent years.</p><p>Living in an urban area with green spaces has a long-lasting positive impact on people&#39;s mental well-being, a study has suggested. UK researchers found moving to a green space had a sustained positive effect, unlike pay rises or promotions, which only provided a short-term boost. Co-author Mathew White, from the University of Exeter, UK, explained that the study showed people living in greener urban areas were displaying fewer signs of depression or anxiety. &quot;There could be a number of reasons,&quot; he said, &quot;for example, people do many things to make themselves happier: they strive for promotion or pay rises, or they get married. But the trouble with those things is that within six months to a year, people are back to their original baseline levels of well-being. So, these things are not sustainable; they don&#39;t make us happy in the long term. We found that for some lottery (彩票) winners who had won more than ￡500,000 the positive effect was definitely there, but after six months to a year, they were back to the baseline.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. White said his team wanted to see whether living in greener urban areas had a lasting positive effect on people&#39;s sense of well-being or whether the effect also disappeared after a period of time.

Timothy June, 54, used to think that he was safe from industrial pollutants （污染物）at his home in Haines-a town with a population of 2,400 people and 4,000 eagles, with 8 million acres of protected wild land nearby. But in early 2007, June agreed to take part in a 36 of 35 Americans from seven states.

The school district, he said, was facing a crisis. Its students were overburdened and stressed out, having to cope with too much work and too many demands. In the previous school year, 120 middle and high school students were recommended for mental health assessments and 40 were hospitalized. And on a survey administered by the district, students wrote things like, &quot;I hate going to school,&quot; and &quot;Coming out of 12 years in this district, I have learned one thing: that a grade, a percentage or even a point is to be valued over anything else.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) With his letter, Aderhold inserted West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District into a national discussion about the intense focus on achievement at elite schools, and whether it has gone too far. At follow-up meetings, he urged parents to join him in advocating a &quot;whole child&quot; approach to schooling that respects &quot;social-emotional development&quot; and &quot;deep and meaningful learning&quot; over academics alone. The alternative, he suggested, was to face the prospect of becoming another Palo Alto, California, where outsize stress on teenage students is believed to have contributed to a number of suicides in the last six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) But instead of bringing families together, Aderhold&#39;s letter revealed a divide in the district, which has 9,700 students, and one that broke down roughly along racial lines. On one side are white parents like Catherine Foley, a former president of the Parent-Teacher-Student Association at her daughter&#39;s middle school, who has come to see the district&#39;s increasingly pressured atmosphere as opposed to learning. &quot;My son was in fourth grade and told me, &#39;I&#39;m not going to amount to anything because I have nothing to put on my resume,&#39;&quot; she said. On the other side are parents like Mike Jia, one of the thousands of Asian-American professionals who have moved to the district in the past decade, who said Aderhold&#39;s reforms would amount to a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of his children&#39;s education. &quot;What is happening here reflects a national anti-intellectual trend that will not prepare our children for the future,&quot; Jia said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) About 10 minutes from Princeton and an hour and a half from New York City, West Windsor and Plainsboro have become popular bedroom communities for technology entrepreneurs, researchers and engineers, drawn in large part by the public schools. From the last three graduating classes, 16 seniors were admitted to MIT. It produces Science Olympiad winners, classically trained musicians and students with perfect SAT scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E) The district has become increasingly popular with immigrant families from China, India and Korea. This year, 65 percent of its students are Asian-American, compared with 44 percent in 2007. Many of them are the first in their families born in the United States. They have had a growing influence on the district. Asian-American parents are enthusiastic supporters of the competitive instrumental music program. They have been huge supporters of the district&#39;s advanced mathematics program, which once began in the fourth grade but will now start in the sixth. The change to the program, in which 90 percent of the participating students are Asian-American, is one of Aderhold&#39;s reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F) Asian-American students have been eager participants in a state program that permits them to take summer classes off campus for high school credit, allowing them to maximize the number of honors and Advanced Placement classes they can take, another practice that Aderhold is limiting this school year. With many Asian-American children attending supplementary instructional programs, there is a perception among some white families that the elementary school curriculum is being sped up to accommodate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G) Both Asian-American and white families say the tension between the two groups has grown steadily over the past few years, as the number of Asian families has risen. But the division has become more obvious in recent months as Aderhold has made changes, including no-homework nights, an end to high school midterms and finals, and an initiative that made it easier to participate in the music program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H) Jennifer Lee, professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the Asian American Achievement Paradox, says misunderstanding between first-generation Asian-American parents and those who have been in this country longer are common. What white middle-class parents do not always understand, she said, is how much pressure recent immigrants feel to boost their children into the middle class. &quot;They don&#39;t have the same chances to get their children internships (实习职位) or jobs at law firms,&quot; Lee said. &quot;So what they believe is that their children must excel and beat their white peers in academic settings so they have the same chances to excel later. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I) The issue of the stresses felt by students in elite school districts has gained attention in recent years as schools in places like Newton, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto have reported a number of suicides. West Windsor-Plainsboro has not had a teenage suicide in recent years, but Aderhold, who has worked in the district for seven years and been chief for the last three years, said he had seen troubling signs. In a recent art assignments, a middle school student depicted (描绘) an overburdened child who was being scolded for earning an A, rather than an A+ , on a math exam. In the image, the mother scolds the student with the words, &quot;Shame on you!&quot; Further, he said, the New Jersey Education Department has flagged at least two pieces of writing on state English language assessments in which students expressed suicidal thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J) The survey commissioned by the district found that 68 percent of high school honor and Advanced Placement students reported feeling stressed about school &quot;always or most of the time.&quot; &quot;We need to bring back some balance,&quot; Aderhold said. &quot;You don&#39;t want to wait until it&#39;s too late to do something. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K) Not all public opinion has fallen along racial lines. Karen Sue, the Chinese-American mother of a fifth-grader and an eighth-grader, believes the competition within the district has gotten out of control. Sue, who was born in the United States to immigrant parents, wants her peers to dial it back. &quot;It&#39;s become an arms race, an educational arms race,&quot; she said. &quot;We all want our kids to achieve and be successful. The question is, at what cost?&quot;</p><p>36. Aderhold is limiting the extra classes that students are allowed to take off campus.<br />\r\n37. White and Asian-American parents responded differently to Aderhold&#39;s appeal.<br />\r\n38. Suicidal thoughts have appeared in some students&#39; writings.<br />\r\n39. Aderhold&#39;s reform of the advanced mathematics program will affect Asian-American students most.<br />\r\n40. Aderhold appealed for parents&#39; support in promoting an all-round development of children, instead of focusing only on their academic performance.<br />\r\n41. One Chinese-American parent thinks the competition in the district has gone too far.<br />\r\n42. Immigrant parents believe that academic excellence will allow their children equal chances to succeed in the future.<br />\r\n43. Many businessmen and professionals have moved to West Windsor and Plainsboro because of the public schools there.<br />\r\n44. A number of students in Aderhold&#39;s school district were found to have stress-induced mental health problems.<br />\r\n45. The tension between Asian-American and white families has increased in recent years.</p><p>Nobody really knows how big Lagos is. What&#39;s indisputable is that it&#39;s growing very quickly. Between now and 2050, the urban population of Africa could triple. Yet cities in sub-Saharan Africa are not getting richer the way cities in the rest of the world have. Most urban Africans live in slums （贫民窟）; migrants are often not much better off than they were in the countryside. Why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The immediate problem is poverty. Most of Africa is urbanising at a lower level of income than other regions of the world did. That means there&#39;s little money around for investment that would make cities liveable and more productive. Without upgrades and new capacity, bridges, roads and power systems are unable to cope with expanding populations. With the exception of South Africa, the only light rail metro system in sub-Saharan Africa is in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Traffic jam leads to expense and unpredictability, things that keep investors away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other parts of the world, increasing agricultural productivity and industrialisation went together. More productive farmers meant there was a surplus that could feed cities; in turn, that created a pool of labour for factories. But African cities are different. They are too often built around consuming natural resources. Government is concentrated in capitals, so is the money. Most urban Africans work for a small minority of the rich, who tend to be involved in either cronyish （有裙带关系的） businesses or politics. Since African agriculture is still broadly unproductive, food is imported, consuming a portion of revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what can be done? Though African countries are poor, not all African cities are. In Lagos, foreign oil workers can pay as much as 65,000 dollars per year in rent for a modest apartment in a safe part of town. If that income were better taxed, it might provide the revenue for better infrastructure. If city leaders were more accountable to their residents, they might favour projects designed to help them more. Yet even as new roads are built, new people arrive. When a city&#39;s population grows by 5% a year, it is difficult to keep up.</p><p>46.What do we learn from the passage about cities in sub-Saharan Africa?<br />\r\nA.They have more slums than other cities in the world.<br />\r\nB.They are growing fast without becoming richer.<br />\r\nC.They are as modernised as many cities elsewhere.<br />\r\nD.They attract migrants who want to be better off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>47.What does the author imply about urbanisation in other parts of the world?<br />\r\nA.It benefited from the contribution of immigrants.<br />\r\nB.It started when people&#39;s income was relatively high.<br />\r\nC.It benefited from the accelerated rise in productivity.<br />\r\nD.It started with the improvement of peopled livelihood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>48.Why is sub-Saharan Africa unappealing to investors?<br />\r\nA.It lacks adequate transport facilities.<br />\r\nB.The living expenses there are too high.<br />\r\nC.It is on the whole too densely populated.<br />\r\nD.The local governments are corrupted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>49.In what way does the author say African cities are different?<br />\r\nA.They have attracted huge numbers of farm labourers.<br />\r\nB.They still rely heavily on agricultural productivity.<br />\r\nC.They have developed at the expense of nature.<br />\r\nD.They depend far more on foreign investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>50.What might be a solution to the problems facing African cities?<br />\r\nA.Lowering of apartment rent.<br />\r\nB.Better education for residents.<br />\r\nC.More rational overall planning.<br />\r\nD.A more responsible government.</p><p>our probably know about the Titanic, but it was actually just one of three state-of-the-art (先进的) ocean ships back in the day. The Olympic class ships were built by the Harland &amp;amp; Wolff ship makers in Northern Ireland for the White Star Line company. The Olympic class included the Olympic, the Britannic and the Titanic. What you may not know is that the Titanic wasn&#39;t even the flagship of this class. All in all, the Olympic class ships were marvels of sea engineering, but they seemed cursed to suffer disastrous fates.</p>\n\n<p>The Olympic launched first in 1910, followed by the Titanic in 1911, and lastly the Britannic in 1914. The ships had nine decks, and White Star Line decided to focus on making them the most luxurious ships on the water.</p>\n\n<p>Stretching 269.13 meters, the Olympic class ships were wonders of naval technology, and everyone thought that they would continue to be so for quite some time. However, all suffered terrible accidents on the open seas. The Olympic got wrecked before the Titanic did, but it was the only one to survive and maintain a successful career of 24 years. The Titanic was the first to sink after famously hitting a huge iceberg in 1912. Following this disaster, the Britannic hit a naval mine in 1916 and subsequently sank as well.</p>\n\n<p>Each ship was coal-powered by several boilers constantly kept running by exhausted crews below deck. Most recognizable of the ship designs are the ship&#39;s smoke stacks, but the fourth stack was actually just artistic in nature and served no functional purpose. While two of these ships sank, they were all designed with double hulls (船体) believed to make them &quot;unsinkable&quot;, perhaps a mistaken idea that led to the Titanic&#39;s and the Britannic&#39;s tragic end.</p>\n\n<p>The Olympic suffered two crashes with other ships and went on to serve as a hospital ship and troop transport in World War I. Eventually, she was taken out of service in 1935, ending the era of the luxurious Olympic class ocean liners.</p><p>51.What does the passage say about the three Olympic class ships?<br />\nA.They performed marvellously on the sea.<br />\nB.They could all break the ice in their way.<br />\nC.They all experienced terrible misfortunes.<br />\nD.They were models of modern engineering.</p>\n\n<p>52.What did White Star Line have in mind when it purchased the three ships?<br />\nA.Their capacity of sailing across all waters.<br />\nB.The utmost comfort passengers could enjoy.<br />\nC.Their ability to survive disasters of any kind.<br />\nD.The long voyages they were able to undertake.</p>\n\n<p>53.What is said about the fourth stack of the ships?<br />\nA.It was a mere piece of decoration.<br />\nB.It was the work of a famous artist.&nbsp;<br />\nC.It was designed to let out extra smoke.<br />\nD.It was easily identifiable from afar.</p>\n\n<p>54.What might have led to the tragic end of the Titanic and the Britannic?<br />\nA.Their unscientific designs.<br />\nB.Their captains&#39; misjudgment.<br />\nC.The assumption that they were built with the latest technology.<br />\nD.The belief that they could never sink with a double-layer body.</p>\n\n<p>55.What happened to the ship Olympic in the end?<br />\nA.She was used to carry troops.<br />\nB.She was sunk in World War I.&nbsp;<br />\nC.She was converted into a hospital ship.<br />\nD.She was retired after her naval service.</p><p>公交车曾是中国人出行的主要交通工具。近年来，由于私家车数量不断增多，城市的交通问题越来越严重。许多城市为了鼓励更多人乘坐公交车出行，一直在努力改善公交车的服务质量。车辆的设施不断更新，车速也有了显著提高。然而，公交车的票价却依然相当低廉。现在，在大多数城市，许多当地老年市民都可以免费乘坐公交车。</p><p>Directions：For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay on how to best handle the relationship between doctors and patients.

However, I believe there is a way for doctors and patients to get along harmoniously -- that is mutual understanding.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, patients are helpless and worried when they go to hospital. So doctor&#39;s attitude or response is critically important for them and their family. On the other hand, doctors have to face so many patients every day that they even have no time to take a rest. Such a high intensity of work could drive a man crazy. Thus, if they can stand in each other&#39;s shoes, most problems could be solved. Otherwise, a doctor&#39;s brief conclusion about the condition of patients might be regarded as cold blood and result in conflicts.\r\n\r\nNowadays, much effort has been made to case the tension of doctor-patient relationship.

Are such accusations simply efforts to score political points for one&#39;s party? Or is there something of particular value about curiosity in and of itself?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[D]The journalist Ian Leslie, in his new and enjoyable book Curious: The Desire to Know and Why Your Future Depends on It, insists that the answer to that last question is &#39;Yes&#39;. Leslie argues that curiosity is a much-overlooked human virtue, crucial to our success, and that we are losing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[E]We are suffering, he writes, from a &quot;serendipity deficit.&quot; The word &quot;serendipity&quot; was coined by Horace Walpole in an 1854 letter, from a tale of three princes who &quot;were always making discoveries, by accident, of things they were not in search of.&quot; Leslie worries that the rise of the Internet, among other social and technological changes, has reduced our appetite for aimless adventures. No longer have we the inclination to let ourselves wander through fields of knowledge, ready to be surprised. Instead, we seek only the information we want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[F]Why is this a problem? Because without curiosity we will lose the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship. We will see unimaginative governments and dying corporations make disastrous decisions. We will lose a vital part of what has made humanity as a whole so successful as a species.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[G]Leslie presents considerable evidence for the proposition that the society as a whole is growing less curious. In the U.S and Europe, for example, the rise of the Internet has led to a declining consumption of news from outside the reader&#39;s borders. But not everything is to be blamed on technology. The decline in interest in literary fiction is also one of the causes identified by Leslie. Reading literary fiction, he says, make us more curious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[H]Moreover, in order to be curious, &quot;you have to be aware of a gap in your knowledge in the first place.&quot; Although Leslie perhaps paints a bit broadly in contending that most of us are unaware of how much we don&#39;t know, he&#39;s surely right to point out that the problem is growing: &quot;Google can give us the powerful illusion that all questions have definite answers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[I]Indeed, Google, for which Leslie expresses admiration, is also his frequent whipping body (替罪羊). He quotes Google co-founder Larry Page to the effect that the &quot;perfect search engine&quot; will &quot;understand exactly what I mean and give me back exactly what I want.&quot; Elsewhere in the book, Leslie writes: &quot;Google aims to save you from the thirst of curiosity altogether.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[J]Somewhat nostalgically (怀旧地), he quotes John Maynard Keynes&#39;s justly famous words of praise to the bookstore: &quot;One should enter it vaguely, almost in a dream, and allow what is there freely to attract and influence the eye. To walk the rounds of the bookshops, dipping in as curiosity dictates, should be an afternoon&#39;s entertainment.&quot; If only!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[K]Citing the work of psychologists and cognitive (认知的) scientists, Leslie criticizes the received wisdom that academic success is the result of a combination of intellectual talent and hard work. Curiosity, he argues, is the third key factor&mdash;and a difficult one to preserve. If not cultivated, it will not survive: &quot;Childhood curiosity is a collaboration between child and adult. The surest way to kill it is to leave it alone.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[L]School education, he warns, is often conducted in a way that makes children incurious. Children of educated and upper-middle-class parents turn out to be far more curious, even at early ages, than children of working class and lower class families. That lack of curiosity produces a relative lack of knowledge, and the lack of knowledge is difficult if not impossible to compensate for later on</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[M]Although Leslie&#39;s book isn&#39;t about politics, he doesn&#39;t entirely shy away from the problem. Political leaders, like leaders of other organizations, should be curious. They should ask questions at crucial moments. There are serious consequence, he warns, in not wanting to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[N]He presents as an example the failure of the George W. Bush administration to prepare properly for the after-effects of the invasion of Iraq. According to Leslie, those who ridiculed former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for his 2002 remark that we have to be wary of the &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; were mistaken. Rumsfeld&#39;s idea, Leslie writes, &quot; wasn&#39;t absurd&mdash;it was smart.&quot; He adds, &quot;The tragedy is that he didn&#39;t follow his own advice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[O]All of which brings us back to Goodell and the Christie case and Benghazi. Each critic in those examples is charging, in a different way, that someone in authority is intentionally being curious. I leave it to the reader&#39;s political preference to decide which, if any, charges should stick. But let&#39;s be careful about demanding curiosity about the other side&#39;s weaknesses and remanding determinedly incurious about our own. We should be delighted to pursue knowledge for its own sake&mdash;even when what we find out is something we didn&#39;t particularly want to know.</p><p>36.To be curious, we need to realize first of all that there are many things we don&#39;t know.<br />\r\n37.According to Leslie, curiosity is essential to one&#39;s success.<br />\r\n38.We should feel happy when we pursue knowledge for knowledge&#39;s sake.<br />\r\n39.Political leaders&#39; lack of curiosity will result in bad consequences.<br />\r\n40.There are often accusations about politicians&#39; and the media&#39;s lack of curiosity to find out the truth<br />\r\n41.The less curious a child is, the less knowledge the child may turn out to have.<br />\r\n42.It is widely accepted that academic accomplishment lies in both intelligence and diligence.<br />\r\n43.Visiting a bookshop as curiosity leads us can be a good way to entertain ourselves.<br />\r\n44.Both the rise of the Internet and reduced appetite for literary fiction contribute to people&#39;s declining curiosity.<br />\r\n45.Mankind wouldn&#39;t be so innovative without curiosity.</p><p>Living in an urban area with green spaces has a long-lasting positive impact on people&#39;s mental well-being, a study has suggested. UK researchers found moving to a green space had a sustained positive effect, unlike pay rises or promotions, which only provided a short-term boost. Co-author Mathew White, from the University of Exeter, UK, explained that the study showed people living in greener urban areas were displaying fewer signs of depression or anxiety. &quot;There could be a number of reasons,&quot; he said, &quot;for example, people do many things to make themselves happier: they strive for promotion or pay rises, or they get married. But the trouble with those things is that within six months to a year, people are back to their original baseline levels of well-being. So, these things are not sustainable; they don&#39;t make us happy in the long term. We found that for some lottery (彩票) winners who had won more than ￡500,000 the positive effect was definitely there, but after six months to a year, they were back to the baseline.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. White said his team wanted to see whether living in greener urban areas had a lasting positive effect on people&#39;s sense of well-being or whether the effect also disappeared after a period of time. To do this, the team used data from the British Household Panel Survey compiled by the University of Essex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explaining what the data revealed, he said: &quot;What you see is that even after three years, mental health is still better, which is unlike many other things that we think will make us happy.&quot; He observed that people living in green spaces were less stressed, and less stressed people made more sensible decisions and communicated better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a growing body of evidence establishing a link between urban green spaces and a positive impact on human well-being, Dr. White said, &quot;There&#39;s growing interest among public policy officials, but the trouble is who funds it.

All in all, the Olympic class ships were marvels of sea engineering, but they seemed cursed to suffer disastrous fates.</p>\n\n<p>The Olympic launched first in 1910, followed by the Titanic in 1911, and lastly the Britannic in 1914. The ships had nine decks, and White Star Line decided to focus on making them the most luxurious ships on the water.</p>\n\n<p>Stretching 269.13 meters, the Olympic class ships were wonders of naval technology, and everyone thought that they would continue to be so for quite some time. However, all suffered terrible accidents on the open seas. The Olympic got wrecked before the Titanic did, but it was the only one to survive and maintain a successful career of 24 years. The Titanic was the first to sink after famously hitting a huge iceberg in 1912. Following this disaster, the Britannic hit a naval mine in 1916 and subsequently sank as well.</p>\n\n<p>Each ship was coal-powered by several boilers constantly kept running by exhausted crews below deck. Most recognizable of the ship designs are the ship&#39;s smoke stacks, but the fourth stack was actually just artistic in nature and served no functional purpose. While two of these ships sank, they were all designed with double hulls (船体) believed to make them &quot;unsinkable&quot;, perhaps a mistaken idea that led to the Titanic&#39;s and the Britannic&#39;s tragic end.</p>\n\n<p>The Olympic suffered two crashes with other ships and went on to serve as a hospital ship and troop transport in World War I. Eventually, she was taken out of service in 1935, ending the era of the luxurious Olympic class ocean liners.</p><p>51.What does the passage say about the three Olympic class ships?<br />\nA.They performed marvellously on the sea.<br />\nB.They could all break the ice in their way.<br />\nC.They all experienced terrible misfortunes.<br />\nD.They were models of modern engineering.</p>\n\n<p>52.What did White Star Line have in mind when it purchased the three ships?<br />\nA.Their capacity of sailing across all waters.<br />\nB.The utmost comfort passengers could enjoy.<br />\nC.Their ability to survive disasters of any kind.<br />\nD.The long voyages they were able to undertake.</p>\n\n<p>53.What is said about the fourth stack of the ships?<br />\nA.It was a mere piece of decoration.<br />\nB.It was the work of a famous artist.&nbsp;<br />\nC.It was designed to let out extra smoke.<br />\nD.It was easily identifiable from afar.</p>\n\n<p>54.What might have led to the tragic end of the Titanic and the Britannic?<br />\nA.Their unscientific designs.<br />\nB.Their captains&#39; misjudgment.<br />\nC.The assumption that they were built with the latest technology.<br />\nD.The belief that they could never sink with a double-layer body.</p>\n\n<p>55.What happened to the ship Olympic in the end?<br />\nA.She was used to carry troops.<br />\nB.She was sunk in World War I.&nbsp;<br />\nC.She was converted into a hospital ship.<br />\nD.She was retired after her naval service.</p><p>在中国文化中，黄颜色是一种很重要的颜色，因为它具有独特的象征意义。在封建(feudal)社会中，它象征统治者的权力和权威。那时，黄色是专为皇帝使用的颜色，皇家宫殿全都漆成黄色，皇袍总是黄色的，而普通老百姓是禁止穿黄色衣服的。在中国，黄色也是收获的象征。秋天庄稼成熟时，田野变得一片金黄。人们兴高采烈，庆祝丰收。</p><p>Directions:<br />\r\nWrite a composition entitled The Problems of Plastic Bags.

Americans view five hours of TV each day, and while we know that spending so much time sitting 36 can lead to obesity (肥胖症) and other diseases, researchers have now quantified just how 37 being a couch potato can be.<br />\r\nIn an analysis of data from eight large 38 published studies, a Harvard-led group reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association that for every two hours per day spent channel 39 , the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes(糖尿病) rose 20% over 8.5 years, the risk of heart disease increased 15% over a 40 , and the odds of dying prematurely 41 13% during a seven-year follow-up. All of these 42 are linked to a lack of physical exercise. But compared with other sedentary(久坐的) activities, like knitting, viewing TV may be especially 43 at promoting unhealthy habits.

As universities go digital, students are complaining of a new hit to their finances that&#39;s replacing&mdash;and sometimes joining&mdash;expensive textbooks: pricey online access codes that are required to complete coursework and submit assignments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) The codes&mdash;which typically range in price from $ 80 to $ 155 per course&mdash;give students online access to systems developed by education companies like McGraw Hill and Pearson. These companies, which long reaped big profits as textbook publishers, have boasted that their new online offerings, when pushed to students through universities they partner with, represent the future of the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) But critics say the digital access codes represent the same profit-seeking ethos (观念) of the textbook business, and are even harder for students to opt out of. While they could once buy second-hand textbooks, or share copies with friends, the digital systems are essentially impossible to avoid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) &quot;When we talk about the access code we see it as the new face of the textbook monopoly (垄断), a new way to lock students around this system,&quot; said Ethan Senack, the higher education advocate for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, to BuzzFeed News. &quot;Rather than $250 (for a print textbook) you&#39;re paying $ 120,&quot; said Senack. &quot;But because it&#39;s all digital it eliminates the used book market and eliminates any sharing and because homework and tests are through an access code, it eliminates any ability to opt out.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E) Sarina Harpet, a 19-year-old student at Virginia Tech, was faced with a tough dilemma when she first started college in 2015&mdash;pay rent or pay to turn in her chemistry homework. She told BuzzFeed News that her freshman chemistry class required her to use Connect, a system provided by McGraw Hill where students can submit homework, take exams and track their grades. But the code to access the program cost $ 120&mdash;a big sum for Harper, who had already put down $ 450 for textbooks, and had rent day approaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F) She decided to wait for her next work-study paycheck, which was typically $ 150- $ 200, to pay for the code. She knew that her chemistry grade may take a dive as a result. &quot;It&#39;s a balancing act,&quot; she said. &quot;Can I really afford these access codes now?&quot; She didn&#39;t hand in her first two assignments for chemistry, which started her out in the class with a failing grade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G) The access codes may be another financial headache for students, but for textbook businesses, they&#39;re the future. McGraw Hill, which controls 21% of the higher education market, reported in March that its digital content sales exceeded print sales for the first time in 2015. The company said that 45% of its $ 140 million revenue in 2015 &quot;was derived from digital products.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H) A Pearson spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that &quot;digital materials are less expensive and a good investment&quot; that offer new features, like audio texts, personalized knowledge checks and expert videos. Its digital course materials save students up to 60% compared to traditional printed textbooks, the company added. McGraw Hill didn&#39;t respond to a request for comment, but its CEO David Levin told the Financial Times in August that &quot;in higher education, the era of the printed textbook is now over.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I) The textbook industry insists the online systems represent a better deal for students. &quot;These digital products aren&#39;t just mechanisms for students to submit homework, they offer all kinds of features,&quot; David Anderson, the executive director of higher education with the Association of American Publishers, told BuzzFeed News. &quot;It helps students understand in a way that you can&#39;t do with print homework assignments.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J) David Hunt, an associate professor in sociology at Augusta University, which has rolled out digital textbooks across its math and psychology departments, told BuzzFeed News that he understands the utility of using systems that require access codes. But he doesn&#39;t require his students to buy access to a learning program that controls the class assignments. &quot;I try to make things as inexpensive as possible,&quot; said Hunt, who uses free digital textbooks for his classes but designs his own curriculum. &quot;The online systems may make my life a lot easier but I feel like I&#39;m giving up control. The discussions are the things where my expertise can benefit the students most.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K) A 20-year-old junior at Georgia Southern University told BuzzFeed News that she normally spends $ 500-$ 600 on access codes for class. In one case, the professor didn&#39;t require students to buy a textbook, just an access code to turn in homework. This year she said she spent $ 900 on access codes to books and programs. &quot;That&#39;s two months of rent,&quot; she said. &quot;You can&#39;t sell any of it back. With a traditional textbook you can sell it for $ 30 - $ 50 and that helps to pay for your new semester&#39;s books. With an access code, you&#39;re out of that money. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>L) Benjamin Wolverton, a 19-year-old student at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News that &quot;it&#39;s ridiculous that after paying tens of thousands in tuition we have to pay for all these access codes to do our homework.&quot; Many of the access codes he&#39;s purchased have been required simply to complete homework or quizzes. &quot;Often it&#39;s only 10% of your grade in class.&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;re paying so much money for something that hardly affects your grade&mdash;but if you didn&#39;t have it, it would affect your grades enough. It would be bad to start out at a B or C.&quot; Wolverton said he spent $ 500 on access codes for digital books and programs this semester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>M) Harper, a poultry (家禽) science major, is taking chemistry again this year and had to buy a new access code to hand in her homework. She rented her economics and statistics textbooks for about $ 20 each. But her access codes for homework, which can&#39;t be rented or bought second-hand, were her most expensive purchases: $ 120 and $ 85.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N) She still remembers the sting of her first experience skipping an assignment due to the high prices. &quot;We don&#39;t really have a missed assignment policy,&quot; she said. &quot;If you miss it, you just miss it. I just got zeros on a couple of first assignments. I managed to pull everything back up. But as a scared freshman looking at their grades, it&#39;s not fun.&quot;</p><p>36. A student&#39;s yearly expenses on access codes may amount to their rent for two months.<br />\r\n37. The online access codes may be seen as a way to tie the students to the digital system.<br />\r\n38. If a student takes a course again, they may have to buy a new access code to submit their assignments.<br />\r\n39. McGraw Hill accounts for over one-fifth of the market share of college textbooks.<br />\r\n40. Many traditional textbook publishers are now offering online digital products, which they believe will be the future of the publishing business.<br />\r\n41. One student complained that they now had to pay for access codes in addition to the high tuition.<br />\r\n42. Digital materials can cost students less than half the price of traditional printed books according to a publisher.<br />\r\n43. One student decided not to buy her access code until she received the pay for her part-time job.<br />\r\n44. Online systems may deprive teachers of opportunities to make the best use of their expertise for their students.<br />\r\n45. Digital access codes are criticized because they are profit-driven just like the textbook business.</p><p>For the past several decades, it seems there&#39;s been a general consensus on how to get ahead in America: Get a college education, find a reliable job, and buy your own home. But do Americans still believe in that path, and if they do, is it attainable?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most recent National Journal poll asked respondents about the American dream, what it takes to achieve their goals, and whether or not they felt a significant amount of control over their ability to be successful. Overwhelmingly, the results show that today， the idea of the American dream&mdash;and what it takes to achieve it&mdash;looks quite different than it did in the late 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By and large, people felt that their actions and hard work&mdash;not outside forces&mdash;were the deciding factor in how their lives turned out. But respondents had decidedly mixed feelings about what actions make for a better life in the current economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last seven years, Americans have grown more pessimistic about the power of education to lead to success. Even though they see going to college as a fairly achievable goal, a majority&mdash;52 percent&mdash;think that young people do not need a four-year college education in order to be successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miguel Maeda, 42, who has a master&#39;s degree and works in public health, was the first in his family to go to college, which has allowed him to achieve a sense of financial stability his parents and grandparents never did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While some, like Maeda, emphasized the value of the degree rather than the education itself, others still see college as a way to gain new perspectives and life experiences. Sixty-year-old Will Fendley, who had a successful career in the military and never earned a college degree, thinks &quot;personal drive&quot; is far more important than just going to college. To Fendley， a sense of drive and purpose, as well as an effective high-school education, and basic life skills, like balancing a checkbook, are the necessary ingredients for a successful life in America.</p><p>51.It used to be commonly acknowledged that to succeed in America, one had to have _____.<br />\r\nA.an advanced academic degree<br />\r\nB.an ambition to get ahead<br />\r\nC.a firm belief in their dream<br />\r\nD.a sense of drive and purpose</p>\r\n\r\n<p>52.What is the finding of the latest National Journal poll concerning the American dream?<br />\r\nA.More and more Americans are finding it hard to realize.<br />\r\nB.It remains alive among the majority of American people.<br />\r\nC.Americans&#39; idea of it has changed over the past few decades.<br />\r\nD.An increasing number of young Americans are abandoning it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>53.What do Americans now think of the role of college education in achieving success?<br />\r\nA.It still remains open to debate.<br />\r\nB.It has proved to be beyond doubt.<br />\r\nC.It is no longer as important as it used to be.<br />\r\nD.It is much better understood now than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>54.How do some people view college education these days?<br />\r\nA.It promotes gender equality.<br />\r\nB.It needs to be strengthened.<br />\r\nC.It adds to cultural diversity.<br />\r\nD.It helps broaden their minds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>55.What is one factor essential to success in America, according to Will Fendley?<br />\r\nA.A desire to learn and to adapt.<br />\r\nB.A strong sense of responsibility.<br />\r\nC.A willingness to commit oneself.<br />\r\nD.A clear aim and high motivation.</p><p>Nobody really knows how big Lagos is. What&#39;s indisputable is that it&#39;s growing very quickly. Between now and 2050, the urban population of Africa could triple. Yet cities in sub-Saharan Africa are not getting richer the way cities in the rest of the world have. Most urban Africans live in slums （贫民窟）; migrants are often not much better off than they were in the countryside. Why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The immediate problem is poverty. Most of Africa is urbanising at a lower level of income than other regions of the world did. That means there&#39;s little money around for investment that would make cities liveable and more productive. Without upgrades and new capacity, bridges, roads and power systems are unable to cope with expanding populations. With the exception of South Africa, the only light rail metro system in sub-Saharan Africa is in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Traffic jam leads to expense and unpredictability, things that keep investors away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other parts of the world, increasing agricultural productivity and industrialisation went together. More productive farmers meant there was a surplus that could feed cities; in turn, that created a pool of labour for factories. But African cities are different. They are too often built around consuming natural resources. Government is concentrated in capitals, so is the money. Most urban Africans work for a small minority of the rich, who tend to be involved in either cronyish （有裙带关系的） businesses or politics. Since African agriculture is still broadly unproductive, food is imported, consuming a portion of revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what can be done? Though African countries are poor, not all African cities are. In Lagos, foreign oil workers can pay as much as 65,000 dollars per year in rent for a modest apartment in a safe part of town. If that income were better taxed, it might provide the revenue for better infrastructure. If city leaders were more accountable to their residents, they might favour projects designed to help them more. Yet even as new roads are built, new people arrive. When a city&#39;s population grows by 5% a year, it is difficult to keep up.</p><p>46.What do we learn from the passage about cities in sub-Saharan Africa?<br />\r\nA.They have more slums than other cities in the world.<br />\r\nB.They are growing fast without becoming richer.<br />\r\nC.They are as modernised as many cities elsewhere.<br />\r\nD.They attract migrants who want to be better off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>47.What does the author imply about urbanisation in other parts of the world?<br />\r\nA.It benefited from the contribution of immigrants.<br />\r\nB.It started when people&#39;s income was relatively high.<br />\r\nC.It benefited from the accelerated rise in productivity.<br />\r\nD.It started with the improvement of peopled livelihood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>48.Why is sub-Saharan Africa unappealing to investors?<br />\r\nA.It lacks adequate transport facilities.<br />\r\nB.The living expenses there are too high.<br />\r\nC.It is on the whole too densely populated.<br />\r\nD.The local governments are corrupted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>49.In what way does the author say African cities are different?<br />\r\nA.They have attracted huge numbers of farm labourers.<br />\r\nB.They still rely heavily on agricultural productivity.<br />\r\nC.They have developed at the expense of nature.<br />\r\nD.They depend far more on foreign investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>50.What might be a solution to the problems facing African cities?<br />\r\nA.Lowering of apartment rent.<br />\r\nB.Better education for residents.<br />\r\nC.More rational overall planning.<br />\r\nD.A more responsible government.</p><p>在山东潍坊市，风筝不仅仅是玩具，而且还是这座城市文化的标志。潍坊以&ldquo;风筝之都&ldquo;而闻名，已有将近2400年放飞风筝的历史。传说中国古代哲学家墨子用了三年时间在潍坊制作了世界上首个风筝，但放飞的第一天风筝就坠落并摔坏了。也有人相信风筝是中国古代木匠鲁班发明的。据说他的风筝用木头和竹子制作，飞了三天后才落地。</p><p>Directions: For this part, you are allowed 30 minutes to write a short essay on the importance of writing ability and how to develop it.

Whether we want to improve our writing skills as a creative writer or simply perfect our skills for schoolwork, we can take some steps to learn how to be a better writer.\r\nFirstly, in order to make our writing creative and imaginative, brainstorming is one of the key elements to build up a unique topic. Don&#39;t hesitate to take down all the ideas that come into our mind. Secondly, a good development of our writing is based on a clear structure or paragraph organization. Even a simple outline will help us see the big picture and save us hours of rewriting. Finally, diversity of vocabulary and grammar used in writing is highly recommended for the reason that one of the most common manifestations of bad writing is overuse or reuse of simple language.\r\nTo sum up, we should take practice and expand our knowledge to become a great writer.

In the U.S and Europe, for example, the rise of the Internet has led to a declining consumption of news from outside the reader&#39;s borders. But not everything is to be blamed on technology. The decline in interest in literary fiction is also one of the causes identified by Leslie. Reading literary fiction, he says, make us more curious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[H]Moreover, in order to be curious, &quot;you have to be aware of a gap in your knowledge in the first place.&quot; Although Leslie perhaps paints a bit broadly in contending that most of us are unaware of how much we don&#39;t know, he&#39;s surely right to point out that the problem is growing: &quot;Google can give us the powerful illusion that all questions have definite answers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[I]Indeed, Google, for which Leslie expresses admiration, is also his frequent whipping body (替罪羊). He quotes Google co-founder Larry Page to the effect that the &quot;perfect search engine&quot; will &quot;understand exactly what I mean and give me back exactly what I want.&quot; Elsewhere in the book, Leslie writes: &quot;Google aims to save you from the thirst of curiosity altogether.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[J]Somewhat nostalgically (怀旧地), he quotes John Maynard Keynes&#39;s justly famous words of praise to the bookstore: &quot;One should enter it vaguely, almost in a dream, and allow what is there freely to attract and influence the eye. To walk the rounds of the bookshops, dipping in as curiosity dictates, should be an afternoon&#39;s entertainment.&quot; If only!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[K]Citing the work of psychologists and cognitive (认知的) scientists, Leslie criticizes the received wisdom that academic success is the result of a combination of intellectual talent and hard work. Curiosity, he argues, is the third key factor&mdash;and a difficult one to preserve. If not cultivated, it will not survive: &quot;Childhood curiosity is a collaboration between child and adult. The surest way to kill it is to leave it alone.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[L]School education, he warns, is often conducted in a way that makes children incurious. Children of educated and upper-middle-class parents turn out to be far more curious, even at early ages, than children of working class and lower class families. That lack of curiosity produces a relative lack of knowledge, and the lack of knowledge is difficult if not impossible to compensate for later on</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[M]Although Leslie&#39;s book isn&#39;t about politics, he doesn&#39;t entirely shy away from the problem. Political leaders, like leaders of other organizations, should be curious. They should ask questions at crucial moments. There are serious consequence, he warns, in not wanting to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[N]He presents as an example the failure of the George W. Bush administration to prepare properly for the after-effects of the invasion of Iraq. According to Leslie, those who ridiculed former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for his 2002 remark that we have to be wary of the &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; were mistaken. Rumsfeld&#39;s idea, Leslie writes, &quot; wasn&#39;t absurd&mdash;it was smart.&quot; He adds, &quot;The tragedy is that he didn&#39;t follow his own advice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[O]All of which brings us back to Goodell and the Christie case and Benghazi. Each critic in those examples is charging, in a different way, that someone in authority is intentionally being curious. I leave it to the reader&#39;s political preference to decide which, if any, charges should stick. But let&#39;s be careful about demanding curiosity about the other side&#39;s weaknesses and remanding determinedly incurious about our own. We should be delighted to pursue knowledge for its own sake&mdash;even when what we find out is something we didn&#39;t particularly want to know.</p><p>36.To be curious, we need to realize first of all that there are many things we don&#39;t know.<br />\r\n37.According to Leslie, curiosity is essential to one&#39;s success.<br />\r\n38.We should feel happy when we pursue knowledge for knowledge&#39;s sake.<br />\r\n39.Political leaders&#39; lack of curiosity will result in bad consequences.<br />\r\n40.There are often accusations about politicians&#39; and the media&#39;s lack of curiosity to find out the truth<br />\r\n41.The less curious a child is, the less knowledge the child may turn out to have.<br />\r\n42.It is widely accepted that academic accomplishment lies in both intelligence and diligence.<br />\r\n43.Visiting a bookshop as curiosity leads us can be a good way to entertain ourselves.<br />\r\n44.Both the rise of the Internet and reduced appetite for literary fiction contribute to people&#39;s declining curiosity.<br />\r\n45.Mankind wouldn&#39;t be so innovative without curiosity.</p><p>Female applicants to postdoctoral positions in geosciences were nearly half as likely to receive excellent letters of recommendation, compared with their male counterparts. Christopher Intagliata reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in many other fields, gender bias is widespread in the sciences. Men score higher starting salaries, have more mentoring (指导), and have better odds of being hired. Studies show they&#39;re also perceived as more competent than women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.fields. And new research reveals that men are more likely to receive excellent letters of recommendation, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Say, you know, this is the best student I&#39;ve ever had,&quot; says Kuheli Dutt, a social scientist and diversity officer at Columbia University&#39;s Lamont campus. &quot;Compare those excellent letters with a merely good letter: &#39;The candidate was productive, or intelligent, or a solid scientist or something that&#39;s clearly solid praise,&#39; but nothing that singles out the candidate as exceptional or one of a kind.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dutt and her colleagues studied more than 1,200 letters of recommendation for postdoctoral positions in geoscience. They were all edited for gender and other identifying information, so Dutt and her team could assign them a score without knowing the gender of the student. They found that female applicants were only half as likely to get outstanding letters, compared with their male counterparts. That includes letters of recommendation from all over the world, and written by, yes, men and women. The findings are in the journal Nature Geoscience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dutt says they were not able to evaluate the actual scientific qualifications of the applicants using the data in the files. But she says the results still suggest women in geoscience are at a potential disadvantage from the very beginning of their careers starting with those less than outstanding letters of recommendation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We&#39;re not trying to assign blame or criticize anyone or call anyone conscious sexist. Rather, the point is to use the results of this study to open up meaningful dialogues on implicit gender bias, be it at a departmental level or an institutional level or even a discipline level.&quot; Which may lead to some recommendations for the letter writers themselves.</p><p>51.What do we learn about applicants to postdoctoral positions in geosciences?<br />\r\nA.There are many more men applying than women.<br />\r\nB.Chances for women to get the positions are scare.<br />\r\nC.More males than females are likely to get outstanding letters of recommendation.<br />\r\nD.Male applicants have more interest in these positions than their female counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>52.What do studies about men and women in scientific research show?<br />\r\nA.Women engaged in postdoctoral work are quickly catching up.<br />\r\nB.Fewer women are applying for postdoctoral positions due to gender bias.<br />\r\nC.Men are believed to be better able to excel in STEM disciplines.<br />\r\nD.Women who are keenly interested in STEM fields are often exceptional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>53.What do the studies find about the recommendation letters for women applicants?<br />\r\nA.They are hardly ever supported by concrete examples.<br />\r\nB.They contain nothing that distinguishes the applicants.<br />\r\nC.They provide objective information without exaggeration.<br />\r\nD.They are often filled with praise for exceptional applicants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>54.What did Dutt and her colleagues do with the more than 1,200 letters of recommendation?<br />\r\nA.They asked unbiased scholars to evaluate them.<br />\r\nB.They invited women professionals to edit them.<br />\r\nC.They assigned them randomly to reviewers.<br />\r\nD.They deleted all information about gender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>55.What does Dutt aim to do with her study?<br />\r\nA.Raise recommendation writers&#39; awareness of gender bias in their letters.<br />\r\nB.Open up fresh avenues for women post-doctors to join in research work.<br />\r\nC.Alert women researchers to all types of gender bias in the STEM disciplines.<br />\r\nD.Start a public discussion on how to raise women&#39;s status in academic circles.</p><p>A new batch of young women&mdash;members of the so-called Millennial (千禧的) generation&mdash;has been entering the workforce for the past decade. At the starting line of their careers, they are better educated than their mothers and grandmothers had been&mdash;or than their young male counterparts are now. But when they look ahead, they see roadblocks to their success. They believe that women are paid less than men for doing the same job. They think it&#39;s easier for men to get top executive jobs than it is for them. And they assume that if and when they have children, it will be even harder for them to advance in their careers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the public sees greater workplace equality between men and women now than it did 20-30 years ago, most believe more change is needed. Among Millennial women, 75% say this country needs to continue making changes to achieve gender equality in the workplace, compared with 57% of Millennial men. Even so, relatively few young women (15%) say they have been discriminated against at work because of their gender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Millennial women come of age they share many of the same views and values about work as their male counterparts. They want jobs that provide security and flexibility, and they place relatively little importance on high pay. At the same time, however, young working women are less likely than men to aim at top management jobs: 34% say they&#39;re not interested in becoming a boss or top manager; only 24% of young men say the same. The gender gap on this question is even wider among working adults in their 30s and 40s, when many women face the trade-offs that go with work and motherhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These findings are based on a new Pew Research Center survey of 2,002 adults, including 810 Millennials (ages 18-32), conducted Oct. 7-27, 2013.

It has becomes such a serious problem that it has aroused the concern from the whole society.\r\n现如今，伴随着城市快速发展的步伐，噪音污染对城市居民的正常生活干扰很大。噪音污染成了一个如此严重的问题，所以引起了整个社会的关注。\r\nTo put an end to such a serious problem, in my mind, calls for the efforts from all sides. First of all, major factories, as main noise creators, should be moved to industrial zones in suburbs. Department stores and big restaurants should not to be established too close to residential quarters. Moreover, the municipal government should increase the ratio of green land in the city, which can reduce all kinds of noises significantly. Last but not least, all urban constructions should be stopped during the night so as not to disturb the neighboring dwellers.\r\n依我看来，要解决这一严重的问题，需要各方的努力。第一，大型工厂作为主要噪音制造者，应该搬到郊外的工业区。百货商店和大型餐厅不应该建得离居民区太近。另外，市政府应该提高城市土地的绿化率，这能很大程度上减少各种噪音。最后但同样重要的是，在夜间，所有的城市建设都应该停止，以防打扰周围的居民。\r\nHow can anybody expect to lead a meaningful life until he is far from noise pollution? Only when all of us join in the efforts of eliminating noise pollution at all levels can we expect to have a better environment and a more beautiful future.(176 words)\r\n如果人们不远离噪音污染，如何期望能在一个意义的人生？只有当我们所有人都加入到消除各种噪音污染的努力中，我们才能期望有一个更好的环境，和更美好的未来。|', '<p>步骤1：<br />\r\n审题：这是一篇以噪音污染为主题的解释说明论文。</p>\r\n\r\n<p>步骤2：<br />\r\n引入话题：简述噪音污染已成为一个严重的社会问题；<br />\r\n展开话题：从三方面阐述解决噪音污染的办法；<br />\r\n话题结论：只有同心协力，才能解决噪音污染问题</p>', '497.00', '23,31,39,33,45,56,', '0');

As universities go digital, students are complaining of a new hit to their finances that&#39;s replacing&mdash;and sometimes joining&mdash;expensive textbooks: pricey online access codes that are required to complete coursework and submit assignments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) The codes&mdash;which typically range in price from $ 80 to $ 155 per course&mdash;give students online access to systems developed by education companies like McGraw Hill and Pearson. These companies, which long reaped big profits as textbook publishers, have boasted that their new online offerings, when pushed to students through universities they partner with, represent the future of the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) But critics say the digital access codes represent the same profit-seeking ethos (观念) of the textbook business, and are even harder for students to opt out of. While they could once buy second-hand textbooks, or share copies with friends, the digital systems are essentially impossible to avoid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) &quot;When we talk about the access code we see it as the new face of the textbook monopoly (垄断), a new way to lock students around this system,&quot; said Ethan Senack, the higher education advocate for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, to BuzzFeed News. &quot;Rather than $250 (for a print textbook) you&#39;re paying $ 120,&quot; said Senack. &quot;But because it&#39;s all digital it eliminates the used book market and eliminates any sharing and because homework and tests are through an access code, it eliminates any ability to opt out.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E) Sarina Harpet, a 19-year-old student at Virginia Tech, was faced with a tough dilemma when she first started college in 2015&mdash;pay rent or pay to turn in her chemistry homework. She told BuzzFeed News that her freshman chemistry class required her to use Connect, a system provided by McGraw Hill where students can submit homework, take exams and track their grades. But the code to access the program cost $ 120&mdash;a big sum for Harper, who had already put down $ 450 for textbooks, and had rent day approaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F) She decided to wait for her next work-study paycheck, which was typically $ 150- $ 200, to pay for the code. She knew that her chemistry grade may take a dive as a result. &quot;It&#39;s a balancing act,&quot; she said. &quot;Can I really afford these access codes now?&quot; She didn&#39;t hand in her first two assignments for chemistry, which started her out in the class with a failing grade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G) The access codes may be another financial headache for students, but for textbook businesses, they&#39;re the future. McGraw Hill, which controls 21% of the higher education market, reported in March that its digital content sales exceeded print sales for the first time in 2015. The company said that 45% of its $ 140 million revenue in 2015 &quot;was derived from digital products.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H) A Pearson spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that &quot;digital materials are less expensive and a good investment&quot; that offer new features, like audio texts, personalized knowledge checks and expert videos. Its digital course materials save students up to 60% compared to traditional printed textbooks, the company added. McGraw Hill didn&#39;t respond to a request for comment, but its CEO David Levin told the Financial Times in August that &quot;in higher education, the era of the printed textbook is now over.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I) The textbook industry insists the online systems represent a better deal for students. &quot;These digital products aren&#39;t just mechanisms for students to submit homework, they offer all kinds of features,&quot; David Anderson, the executive director of higher education with the Association of American Publishers, told BuzzFeed News. &quot;It helps students understand in a way that you can&#39;t do with print homework assignments.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J) David Hunt, an associate professor in sociology at Augusta University, which has rolled out digital textbooks across its math and psychology departments, told BuzzFeed News that he understands the utility of using systems that require access codes. But he doesn&#39;t require his students to buy access to a learning program that controls the class assignments. &quot;I try to make things as inexpensive as possible,&quot; said Hunt, who uses free digital textbooks for his classes but designs his own curriculum. &quot;The online systems may make my life a lot easier but I feel like I&#39;m giving up control. The discussions are the things where my expertise can benefit the students most.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K) A 20-year-old junior at Georgia Southern University told BuzzFeed News that she normally spends $ 500-$ 600 on access codes for class. In one case, the professor didn&#39;t require students to buy a textbook, just an access code to turn in homework. This year she said she spent $ 900 on access codes to books and programs. &quot;That&#39;s two months of rent,&quot; she said. &quot;You can&#39;t sell any of it back. With a traditional textbook you can sell it for $ 30 - $ 50 and that helps to pay for your new semester&#39;s books. With an access code, you&#39;re out of that money. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>L) Benjamin Wolverton, a 19-year-old student at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News that &quot;it&#39;s ridiculous that after paying tens of thousands in tuition we have to pay for all these access codes to do our homework.&quot; Many of the access codes he&#39;s purchased have been required simply to complete homework or quizzes. &quot;Often it&#39;s only 10% of your grade in class.&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;re paying so much money for something that hardly affects your grade&mdash;but if you didn&#39;t have it, it would affect your grades enough. It would be bad to start out at a B or C.&quot; Wolverton said he spent $ 500 on access codes for digital books and programs this semester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>M) Harper, a poultry (家禽) science major, is taking chemistry again this year and had to buy a new access code to hand in her homework. She rented her economics and statistics textbooks for about $ 20 each. But her access codes for homework, which can&#39;t be rented or bought second-hand, were her most expensive purchases: $ 120 and $ 85.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N) She still remembers the sting of her first experience skipping an assignment due to the high prices. &quot;We don&#39;t really have a missed assignment policy,&quot; she said. &quot;If you miss it, you just miss it. I just got zeros on a couple of first assignments. I managed to pull everything back up. But as a scared freshman looking at their grades, it&#39;s not fun.&quot;</p><p>36. A student&#39;s yearly expenses on access codes may amount to their rent for two months.<br />\r\n37. The online access codes may be seen as a way to tie the students to the digital system.<br />\r\n38. If a student takes a course again, they may have to buy a new access code to submit their assignments.<br />\r\n39. McGraw Hill accounts for over one-fifth of the market share of college textbooks.<br />\r\n40. Many traditional textbook publishers are now offering online digital products, which they believe will be the future of the publishing business.<br />\r\n41. One student complained that they now had to pay for access codes in addition to the high tuition.<br />\r\n42. Digital materials can cost students less than half the price of traditional printed books according to a publisher.<br />\r\n43. One student decided not to buy her access code until she received the pay for her part-time job.<br />\r\n44. Online systems may deprive teachers of opportunities to make the best use of their expertise for their students.<br />\r\n45. Digital access codes are criticized because they are profit-driven just like the textbook business.</p><p>our probably know about the Titanic, but it was actually just one of three state-of-the-art (先进的) ocean ships back in the day. The Olympic class ships were built by the Harland &amp;amp; Wolff ship makers in Northern Ireland for the White Star Line company. The Olympic class included the Olympic, the Britannic and the Titanic. What you may not know is that the Titanic wasn&#39;t even the flagship of this class. All in all, the Olympic class ships were marvels of sea engineering, but they seemed cursed to suffer disastrous fates.</p>\n\n<p>The Olympic launched first in 1910, followed by the Titanic in 1911, and lastly the Britannic in 1914. The ships had nine decks, and White Star Line decided to focus on making them the most luxurious ships on the water.</p>\n\n<p>Stretching 269.13 meters, the Olympic class ships were wonders of naval technology, and everyone thought that they would continue to be so for quite some time. However, all suffered terrible accidents on the open seas. The Olympic got wrecked before the Titanic did, but it was the only one to survive and maintain a successful career of 24 years. The Titanic was the first to sink after famously hitting a huge iceberg in 1912. Following this disaster, the Britannic hit a naval mine in 1916 and subsequently sank as well.</p>\n\n<p>Each ship was coal-powered by several boilers constantly kept running by exhausted crews below deck. Most recognizable of the ship designs are the ship&#39;s smoke stacks, but the fourth stack was actually just artistic in nature and served no functional purpose. While two of these ships sank, they were all designed with double hulls (船体) believed to make them &quot;unsinkable&quot;, perhaps a mistaken idea that led to the Titanic&#39;s and the Britannic&#39;s tragic end.</p>\n\n<p>The Olympic suffered two crashes with other ships and went on to serve as a hospital ship and troop transport in World War I. Eventually, she was taken out of service in 1935, ending the era of the luxurious Olympic class ocean liners.</p><p>51.What does the passage say about the three Olympic class ships?<br />\nA.They performed marvellously on the sea.<br />\nB.They could all break the ice in their way.<br />\nC.They all experienced terrible misfortunes.<br />\nD.They were models of modern engineering.</p>\n\n<p>52.What did White Star Line have in mind when it purchased the three ships?<br />\nA.Their capacity of sailing across all waters.<br />\nB.The utmost comfort passengers could enjoy.<br />\nC.Their ability to survive disasters of any kind.<br />\nD.The long voyages they were able to undertake.</p>\n\n<p>53.What is said about the fourth stack of the ships?<br />\nA.It was a mere piece of decoration.<br />\nB.It was the work of a famous artist.&nbsp;<br />\nC.It was designed to let out extra smoke.<br />\nD.It was easily identifiable from afar.</p>\n\n<p>54.What might have led to the tragic end of the Titanic and the Britannic?<br />\nA.Their unscientific designs.<br />\nB.Their captains&#39; misjudgment.<br />\nC.The assumption that they were built with the latest technology.<br />\nD.The belief that they could never sink with a double-layer body.</p>\n\n<p>55.What happened to the ship Olympic in the end?<br />\nA.She was used to carry troops.<br />\nB.She was sunk in World War I.&nbsp;<br />\nC.She was converted into a hospital ship.<br />\nD.She was retired after her naval service.</p><p>A letter written by Charles Darwin in 1875 has been returned to the Smithsonian Institution Archives (档案馆) by the FBI after being stolen twice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We realized in the mid-1970s that it was missing,&quot; says Effie Kapsalis, head of the Smithsonian Insitution Archives. &quot;It was noted as missing and likely taken by an intern (实习生), from what the FBI is telling us. Word got out that it was missing when someone asked to see the letter for research purposes,&quot; and the intern put the letter back. &quot;The intern likely took the letter again once nobody was watching it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decades passed. Finally, the FBI received a tip that the stolen document was located very close to Washington, D.C. Their art crime team recovered the letter but were unable to press charges because the time of limitations had ended.

INSERT INTO `model` VALUES ('17', 'This fall', '2', '<p>A) This fall, David Aderhold, the chief of a high-achieving school district near Princeton, New Jersey, sent parents an alarming 16-page letter. The school district, he said, was facing a crisis. Its students were overburdened and stressed out, having to cope with too much work and too many demands. In the previous school year, 120 middle and high school students were recommended for mental health assessments and 40 were hospitalized. And on a survey administered by the district, students wrote things like, &quot;I hate going to school,&quot; and &quot;Coming out of 12 years in this district, I have learned one thing: that a grade, a percentage or even a point is to be valued over anything else.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) With his letter, Aderhold inserted West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District into a national discussion about the intense focus on achievement at elite schools, and whether it has gone too far. At follow-up meetings, he urged parents to join him in advocating a &quot;whole child&quot; approach to schooling that respects &quot;social-emotional development&quot; and &quot;deep and meaningful learning&quot; over academics alone. The alternative, he suggested, was to face the prospect of becoming another Palo Alto, California, where outsize stress on teenage students is believed to have contributed to a number of suicides in the last six years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) But instead of bringing families together, Aderhold&#39;s letter revealed a divide in the district, which has 9,700 students, and one that broke down roughly along racial lines. On one side are white parents like Catherine Foley, a former president of the Parent-Teacher-Student Association at her daughter&#39;s middle school, who has come to see the district&#39;s increasingly pressured atmosphere as opposed to learning. &quot;My son was in fourth grade and told me, &#39;I&#39;m not going to amount to anything because I have nothing to put on my resume,&#39;&quot; she said. On the other side are parents like Mike Jia, one of the thousands of Asian-American professionals who have moved to the district in the past decade, who said Aderhold&#39;s reforms would amount to a &quot;dumbing down&quot; of his children&#39;s education. &quot;What is happening here reflects a national anti-intellectual trend that will not prepare our children for the future,&quot; Jia said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) About 10 minutes from Princeton and an hour and a half from New York City, West Windsor and Plainsboro have become popular bedroom communities for technology entrepreneurs, researchers and engineers, drawn in large part by the public schools. From the last three graduating classes, 16 seniors were admitted to MIT. It produces Science Olympiad winners, classically trained musicians and students with perfect SAT scores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E) The district has become increasingly popular with immigrant families from China, India and Korea. This year, 65 percent of its students are Asian-American, compared with 44 percent in 2007. Many of them are the first in their families born in the United States. They have had a growing influence on the district. Asian-American parents are enthusiastic supporters of the competitive instrumental music program. They have been huge supporters of the district&#39;s advanced mathematics program, which once began in the fourth grade but will now start in the sixth. The change to the program, in which 90 percent of the participating students are Asian-American, is one of Aderhold&#39;s reforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F) Asian-American students have been eager participants in a state program that permits them to take summer classes off campus for high school credit, allowing them to maximize the number of honors and Advanced Placement classes they can take, another practice that Aderhold is limiting this school year. With many Asian-American children attending supplementary instructional programs, there is a perception among some white families that the elementary school curriculum is being sped up to accommodate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G) Both Asian-American and white families say the tension between the two groups has grown steadily over the past few years, as the number of Asian families has risen. But the division has become more obvious in recent months as Aderhold has made changes, including no-homework nights, an end to high school midterms and finals, and an initiative that made it easier to participate in the music program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H) Jennifer Lee, professor of sociology at the University of California, Irvine, and an author of the Asian American Achievement Paradox, says misunderstanding between first-generation Asian-American parents and those who have been in this country longer are common. What white middle-class parents do not always understand, she said, is how much pressure recent immigrants feel to boost their children into the middle class. &quot;They don&#39;t have the same chances to get their children internships (实习职位) or jobs at law firms,&quot; Lee said. &quot;So what they believe is that their children must excel and beat their white peers in academic settings so they have the same chances to excel later. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I) The issue of the stresses felt by students in elite school districts has gained attention in recent years as schools in places like Newton, Massachusetts, and Palo Alto have reported a number of suicides. West Windsor-Plainsboro has not had a teenage suicide in recent years, but Aderhold, who has worked in the district for seven years and been chief for the last three years, said he had seen troubling signs. In a recent art assignments, a middle school student depicted (描绘) an overburdened child who was being scolded for earning an A, rather than an A+ , on a math exam. In the image, the mother scolds the student with the words, &quot;Shame on you!&quot; Further, he said, the New Jersey Education Department has flagged at least two pieces of writing on state English language assessments in which students expressed suicidal thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J) The survey commissioned by the district found that 68 percent of high school honor and Advanced Placement students reported feeling stressed about school &quot;always or most of the time.&quot; &quot;We need to bring back some balance,&quot; Aderhold said. &quot;You don&#39;t want to wait until it&#39;s too late to do something. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K) Not all public opinion has fallen along racial lines. Karen Sue, the Chinese-American mother of a fifth-grader and an eighth-grader, believes the competition within the district has gotten out of control. Sue, who was born in the United States to immigrant parents, wants her peers to dial it back. &quot;It&#39;s become an arms race, an educational arms race,&quot; she said. &quot;We all want our kids to achieve and be successful. The question is, at what cost?&quot;</p>', '<p>36. Aderhold is limiting the extra classes that students are allowed to take off campus.<br />\r\n37. White and Asian-American parents responded differently to Aderhold&#39;s appeal.<br />\r\n38. Suicidal thoughts have appeared in some students&#39; writings.<br />\r\n39. Aderhold&#39;s reform of the advanced mathematics program will affect Asian-American students most.<br />\r\n40. Aderhold appealed for parents&#39; support in promoting an all-round development of children, instead of focusing only on their academic performance.<br />\r\n41. One Chinese-American parent thinks the competition in the district has gone too far.<br />\r\n42. Immigrant parents believe that academic excellence will allow their children equal chances to succeed in the future.<br />\r\n43. Many businessmen and professionals have moved to West Windsor and Plainsboro because of the public schools there.<br />\r\n44. A number of students in Aderhold&#39;s school district were found to have stress-induced mental health problems.<br />\r\n45. The tension between Asian-American and white families has increased in recent years.</p>', 'F|C|I|E|B|K|H|D|A|G', '', '0', '枫叶落雪', '71.00', '2019-03-13 14:59:43', '2019-03-13 14:59:43');

UK researchers found moving to a green space had a sustained positive effect, unlike pay rises or promotions, which only provided a short-term boost. Co-author Mathew White, from the University of Exeter, UK, explained that the study showed people living in greener urban areas were displaying fewer signs of depression or anxiety. &quot;There could be a number of reasons,&quot; he said, &quot;for example, people do many things to make themselves happier: they strive for promotion or pay rises, or they get married. But the trouble with those things is that within six months to a year, people are back to their original baseline levels of well-being. So, these things are not sustainable; they don&#39;t make us happy in the long term.

As universities go digital, students are complaining of a new hit to their finances that&#39;s replacing&mdash;and sometimes joining&mdash;expensive textbooks: pricey online access codes that are required to complete coursework and submit assignments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) The codes&mdash;which typically range in price from $ 80 to $ 155 per course&mdash;give students online access to systems developed by education companies like McGraw Hill and Pearson. These companies, which long reaped big profits as textbook publishers, have boasted that their new online offerings, when pushed to students through universities they partner with, represent the future of the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) But critics say the digital access codes represent the same profit-seeking ethos (观念) of the textbook business, and are even harder for students to opt out of. While they could once buy second-hand textbooks, or share copies with friends, the digital systems are essentially impossible to avoid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D) &quot;When we talk about the access code we see it as the new face of the textbook monopoly (垄断), a new way to lock students around this system,&quot; said Ethan Senack, the higher education advocate for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, to BuzzFeed News. &quot;Rather than $250 (for a print textbook) you&#39;re paying $ 120,&quot; said Senack. &quot;But because it&#39;s all digital it eliminates the used book market and eliminates any sharing and because homework and tests are through an access code, it eliminates any ability to opt out.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E) Sarina Harpet, a 19-year-old student at Virginia Tech, was faced with a tough dilemma when she first started college in 2015&mdash;pay rent or pay to turn in her chemistry homework. She told BuzzFeed News that her freshman chemistry class required her to use Connect, a system provided by McGraw Hill where students can submit homework, take exams and track their grades. But the code to access the program cost $ 120&mdash;a big sum for Harper, who had already put down $ 450 for textbooks, and had rent day approaching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>F) She decided to wait for her next work-study paycheck, which was typically $ 150- $ 200, to pay for the code. She knew that her chemistry grade may take a dive as a result. &quot;It&#39;s a balancing act,&quot; she said. &quot;Can I really afford these access codes now?&quot; She didn&#39;t hand in her first two assignments for chemistry, which started her out in the class with a failing grade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>G) The access codes may be another financial headache for students, but for textbook businesses, they&#39;re the future. McGraw Hill, which controls 21% of the higher education market, reported in March that its digital content sales exceeded print sales for the first time in 2015. The company said that 45% of its $ 140 million revenue in 2015 &quot;was derived from digital products.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>H) A Pearson spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that &quot;digital materials are less expensive and a good investment&quot; that offer new features, like audio texts, personalized knowledge checks and expert videos. Its digital course materials save students up to 60% compared to traditional printed textbooks, the company added. McGraw Hill didn&#39;t respond to a request for comment, but its CEO David Levin told the Financial Times in August that &quot;in higher education, the era of the printed textbook is now over.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I) The textbook industry insists the online systems represent a better deal for students. &quot;These digital products aren&#39;t just mechanisms for students to submit homework, they offer all kinds of features,&quot; David Anderson, the executive director of higher education with the Association of American Publishers, told BuzzFeed News. &quot;It helps students understand in a way that you can&#39;t do with print homework assignments.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J) David Hunt, an associate professor in sociology at Augusta University, which has rolled out digital textbooks across its math and psychology departments, told BuzzFeed News that he understands the utility of using systems that require access codes. But he doesn&#39;t require his students to buy access to a learning program that controls the class assignments. &quot;I try to make things as inexpensive as possible,&quot; said Hunt, who uses free digital textbooks for his classes but designs his own curriculum. &quot;The online systems may make my life a lot easier but I feel like I&#39;m giving up control. The discussions are the things where my expertise can benefit the students most.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>K) A 20-year-old junior at Georgia Southern University told BuzzFeed News that she normally spends $ 500-$ 600 on access codes for class. In one case, the professor didn&#39;t require students to buy a textbook, just an access code to turn in homework. This year she said she spent $ 900 on access codes to books and programs. &quot;That&#39;s two months of rent,&quot; she said. &quot;You can&#39;t sell any of it back. With a traditional textbook you can sell it for $ 30 - $ 50 and that helps to pay for your new semester&#39;s books. With an access code, you&#39;re out of that money. &quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>L) Benjamin Wolverton, a 19-year-old student at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News that &quot;it&#39;s ridiculous that after paying tens of thousands in tuition we have to pay for all these access codes to do our homework.&quot; Many of the access codes he&#39;s purchased have been required simply to complete homework or quizzes. &quot;Often it&#39;s only 10% of your grade in class.&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;re paying so much money for something that hardly affects your grade&mdash;but if you didn&#39;t have it, it would affect your grades enough. It would be bad to start out at a B or C.&quot; Wolverton said he spent $ 500 on access codes for digital books and programs this semester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>M) Harper, a poultry (家禽) science major, is taking chemistry again this year and had to buy a new access code to hand in her homework. She rented her economics and statistics textbooks for about $ 20 each. But her access codes for homework, which can&#39;t be rented or bought second-hand, were her most expensive purchases: $ 120 and $ 85.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>N) She still remembers the sting of her first experience skipping an assignment due to the high prices. &quot;We don&#39;t really have a missed assignment policy,&quot; she said. &quot;If you miss it, you just miss it. I just got zeros on a couple of first assignments. I managed to pull everything back up. But as a scared freshman looking at their grades, it&#39;s not fun.&quot;</p>', '<p>36. A student&#39;s yearly expenses on access codes may amount to their rent for two months.<br />\r\n37. The online access codes may be seen as a way to tie the students to the digital system.<br />\r\n38. If a student takes a course again, they may have to buy a new access code to submit their assignments.<br />\r\n39. McGraw Hill accounts for over one-fifth of the market share of college textbooks.<br />\r\n40. Many traditional textbook publishers are now offering online digital products, which they believe will be the future of the publishing business.<br />\r\n41. One student complained that they now had to pay for access codes in addition to the high tuition.<br />\r\n42. Digital materials can cost students less than half the price of traditional printed books according to a publisher.<br />\r\n43. One student decided not to buy her access code until she received the pay for her part-time job.<br />\r\n44. Online systems may deprive teachers of opportunities to make the best use of their expertise for their students.<br />\r\n45.

As I discovered in college, when my hands are busy, my mind stays focused on the here and now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[D]It seems, too, that I&#39;m part of a national renewal of interest in needle and other handicrafts （手工艺）. The Craft Yarn Council reports that a third of women ages 25-35 now knit or crochet. Even men and schoolchildren are swelling the ranks, among them my friend&#39;s three small grandsons. Last April, the council created a &quot;Stitch Away Stress&quot; campaign in honor of National Stress Awareness Month. Dr. Herbert Benson, a pioneer in mind/body medicine and author of The Relaxation Response, says that the repetitive action of needlework can induce a relaxed state like that associated with meditation （沉思） and yoga. Once you get beyond the initial learning curve, knitting and crocheting can lower heart rate and blood pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[E]But unlike meditation, craft activities result in tangible and often useful products that can enhance self-esteem. I keep photos of my singular accomplishments on my cellphone to boost my spirits when needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[F]Since the 1990s, the council has surveyed hundreds of thousands of knitters and crocheters, who routinely list stress relief and creative fulfillment as the activities&#39; main benefits. Among them is the father of a prematurely born daughter who reported that during the baby&#39;s five weeks in the intensive care unit, &quot;learning how to knit infant hats gave me a sense of purpose during a time that I felt very helpless. It&#39;s a hobby that I&#39;ve stuck with, and it continues to help me cope with stress at work, provide a sense of order in hectic （忙乱的） days, and allow my brain time to solve problems.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[G]A recent email from the yarn （纺纱） company Red Heart titled &quot;Health Benefits of Crocheting and Knitting&quot; prompted me to explore what else might be known about the health value of activities like knitting. My research revealed that the rewards go well beyond replacing stress and anxiety with the satisfaction of creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[H]For example, Karen Hayes, a life coach in Toronto, conducts knitting therapy programs, including Knit to Quit to help smokers give up the habit, and Knit to Heal for people coping with health crises, like a cancer diagnosis or serious illness of a family member. Schools and prisons with craft programs report that they have a calming effect and enhance social skills. And having to follow instructions on complex craft projects can improve children&#39;s math skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[I]Some people find that craftwork helps them control their weight. Just as it&#39;s challenging to smoke while knitting, when hands are holding needles and hooks, there&#39;s less snacking and mindless eating out of boredom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[J]I&#39;ve found that my handiwork with yarn has helped my arthritic （患关节炎的） fingers remain more dexterous （灵巧的） as I age. A woman encouraged to try knitting and crocheting after developing an autoimmune disease that caused a lot of hand pain reported on the Craft Yarn Council site that her hands are now less stiff and painful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[K]A 2009 University of British Columbia study of 38 women with an eating disorder who were taught to knit found that learning the craft led to significant improvements. Seventy-four percent of the women said the activity lessened their fears and kept them from thinking about their problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[L]Betsan Corkhill, a wellness coach in Bath, England, and author of the book Knit for Health &amp;amp; Wellness, established a website, Stitchlinks, to explore the value of what she calls therapeutic knitting. Among her respondents, 54 percent of those who were clinically depressed said that knitting made them feel happy or very happy. In a study of 60 self-selected people with persistent pain, Ms. Corkhill and colleagues reported that knitting enabled them to redirect their focus, reducing their awareness of pain. She suggested that the brain can process just so much at once, and that activities like knitting and crocheting make it harder for the brain to register pain signals. Perhaps most exciting is research that suggests that crafts like knitting and crocheting may help to keep off a decline in brain function with age. In a 2011 study, researchers led by Dr. Yonas Geda at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester interviewed a random （随机的） sample of 1,321 people ages 70-89, most of whom were cognitively （在认知方面） normal, about the cognitive activities they engaged in late in life. The study, published in the Journal of Neuropsychiatry &amp;amp; Clinical Neurosciences, found that those who engaged in crafts like knitting and crocheting had a diminished chance of developing mild cognitive disorder and memory loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[M]Although it is possible that only people who are cognitively healthy would pursue such activities, those who read newspapers or magazines or played music did not show similar benefits. The researchers speculate that craft activities promote the development of nerve pathways in the brain that help to maintain cognitive health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[N]In support of that suggestion, a 2014 study by Denise C. Park of the University of Texas at Dallas and colleagues demonstrated that learning to knit or do digital photography enhanced memory function in older adults. Those who engaged in activities that were not intellectually challenging, either in a social group or alone, did not show such improvements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[O]Given that sustained social contacts have been shown to support health and a long life, those wishing to maximize the health value of crafts might consider joining a group of like-minded folks. I for one try not to miss a single weekly meeting of my knitting group.</p>', '<p>36.When the author was a college student, she found that knitting helped her concentrate.<br />\r\n37.Knitting can help people stay away from tobacco.<br />\r\n38.Even men and children are now joining the army of knitters.<br />\r\n39.Being a member of a crafts group enhance one&#39;s health and prolongs one&#39;s life.<br />\r\n40.Knitting diverts people&#39;s attention from their pain.<br />\r\n41.The author learnt to knit as a teenager, but it was not until she was much older that she became keenly interested.<br />\r\n42.When people are knitting, they tend to eat fewer snacks.<br />\r\n43.Survey findings show that knitting can help people relieve stress.<br />\r\n44.According to a study, knitters and crocheters are less likely to suffer mild cognitive damage.<br />\r\n45.The products of knitting can increase one&#39;s sense of self-respect.</p>', 'C|H|D|O|L|B|I|F|L|E', '', '1', 'tom', '71.00', '2019-04-24 18:48:25', '2019-04-24 18:48:25');

Are such accusations simply efforts to score political points for one&#39;s party? Or is there something of particular value about curiosity in and of itself?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[D]The journalist Ian Leslie, in his new and enjoyable book Curious: The Desire to Know and Why Your Future Depends on It, insists that the answer to that last question is &#39;Yes&#39;. Leslie argues that curiosity is a much-overlooked human virtue, crucial to our success, and that we are losing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[E]We are suffering, he writes, from a &quot;serendipity deficit.&quot; The word &quot;serendipity&quot; was coined by Horace Walpole in an 1854 letter, from a tale of three princes who &quot;were always making discoveries, by accident, of things they were not in search of.&quot; Leslie worries that the rise of the Internet, among other social and technological changes, has reduced our appetite for aimless adventures. No longer have we the inclination to let ourselves wander through fields of knowledge, ready to be surprised. Instead, we seek only the information we want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[F]Why is this a problem? Because without curiosity we will lose the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship. We will see unimaginative governments and dying corporations make disastrous decisions. We will lose a vital part of what has made humanity as a whole so successful as a species.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[G]Leslie presents considerable evidence for the proposition that the society as a whole is growing less curious. In the U.S and Europe, for example, the rise of the Internet has led to a declining consumption of news from outside the reader&#39;s borders. But not everything is to be blamed on technology. The decline in interest in literary fiction is also one of the causes identified by Leslie. Reading literary fiction, he says, make us more curious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[H]Moreover, in order to be curious, &quot;you have to be aware of a gap in your knowledge in the first place.&quot; Although Leslie perhaps paints a bit broadly in contending that most of us are unaware of how much we don&#39;t know, he&#39;s surely right to point out that the problem is growing: &quot;Google can give us the powerful illusion that all questions have definite answers.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[I]Indeed, Google, for which Leslie expresses admiration, is also his frequent whipping body (替罪羊). He quotes Google co-founder Larry Page to the effect that the &quot;perfect search engine&quot; will &quot;understand exactly what I mean and give me back exactly what I want.&quot; Elsewhere in the book, Leslie writes: &quot;Google aims to save you from the thirst of curiosity altogether.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[J]Somewhat nostalgically (怀旧地), he quotes John Maynard Keynes&#39;s justly famous words of praise to the bookstore: &quot;One should enter it vaguely, almost in a dream, and allow what is there freely to attract and influence the eye. To walk the rounds of the bookshops, dipping in as curiosity dictates, should be an afternoon&#39;s entertainment.&quot; If only!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[K]Citing the work of psychologists and cognitive (认知的) scientists, Leslie criticizes the received wisdom that academic success is the result of a combination of intellectual talent and hard work. Curiosity, he argues, is the third key factor&mdash;and a difficult one to preserve. If not cultivated, it will not survive: &quot;Childhood curiosity is a collaboration between child and adult. The surest way to kill it is to leave it alone.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[L]School education, he warns, is often conducted in a way that makes children incurious. Children of educated and upper-middle-class parents turn out to be far more curious, even at early ages, than children of working class and lower class families. That lack of curiosity produces a relative lack of knowledge, and the lack of knowledge is difficult if not impossible to compensate for later on</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[M]Although Leslie&#39;s book isn&#39;t about politics, he doesn&#39;t entirely shy away from the problem. Political leaders, like leaders of other organizations, should be curious. They should ask questions at crucial moments. There are serious consequence, he warns, in not wanting to know.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[N]He presents as an example the failure of the George W. Bush administration to prepare properly for the after-effects of the invasion of Iraq. According to Leslie, those who ridiculed former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for his 2002 remark that we have to be wary of the &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; were mistaken. Rumsfeld&#39;s idea, Leslie writes, &quot; wasn&#39;t absurd&mdash;it was smart.&quot; He adds, &quot;The tragedy is that he didn&#39;t follow his own advice.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[O]All of which brings us back to Goodell and the Christie case and Benghazi. Each critic in those examples is charging, in a different way, that someone in authority is intentionally being curious. I leave it to the reader&#39;s political preference to decide which, if any, charges should stick. But let&#39;s be careful about demanding curiosity about the other side&#39;s weaknesses and remanding determinedly incurious about our own. We should be delighted to pursue knowledge for its own sake&mdash;even when what we find out is something we didn&#39;t particularly want to know.</p>', '<p>36.To be curious, we need to realize first of all that there are many things we don&#39;t know.<br />\r\n37.According to Leslie, curiosity is essential to one&#39;s success.<br />\r\n38.We should feel happy when we pursue knowledge for knowledge&#39;s sake.<br />\r\n39.Political leaders&#39; lack of curiosity will result in bad consequences.<br />\r\n40.There are often accusations about politicians&#39; and the media&#39;s lack of curiosity to find out the truth<br />\r\n41.The less curious a child is, the less knowledge the child may turn out to have.<br />\r\n42.It is widely accepted that academic accomplishment lies in both intelligence and diligence.<br />\r\n43.Visiting a bookshop as curiosity leads us can be a good way to entertain ourselves.<br />\r\n44.Both the rise of the Internet and reduced appetite for literary fiction contribute to people&#39;s declining curiosity.<br />\r\n45.Mankind wouldn&#39;t be so innovative without curiosity.</p>', 'H|D|O|M|B|L|K|J|G|F', '', '0', 'tom', '71.00', '2019-04-24 18:49:33', '2019-04-24 18:49:33');

Student teachers score higher on tests than pupils who&#39;re learning only for their own sake. But how can children, still learning themselves, teach others? One answer: They can tutor younger kids. Some studies have found that first-born children are more intelligent than their later-born siblings (兄弟姐妹). This suggests their higher IQs result from the time they spend teaching their siblings. Now educators are experimenting with ways to apply this model to academic subjects. They engage college undergraduates to teach computer science to high school students, who in turn instruct middle school students on the topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the most cutting-edge tool under development is the &quot;teachable agent&quot;&mdash;a computerized character who learns, tries, makes mistakes and asks questions just like a real-world pupil.

Most urban Africans live in slums （贫民窟）; migrants are often not much better off than they were in the countryside. Why?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The immediate problem is poverty. Most of Africa is urbanising at a lower level of income than other regions of the world did. That means there&#39;s little money around for investment that would make cities liveable and more productive. Without upgrades and new capacity, bridges, roads and power systems are unable to cope with expanding populations. With the exception of South Africa, the only light rail metro system in sub-Saharan Africa is in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Traffic jam leads to expense and unpredictability, things that keep investors away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other parts of the world, increasing agricultural productivity and industrialisation went together. More productive farmers meant there was a surplus that could feed cities; in turn, that created a pool of labour for factories. But African cities are different. They are too often built around consuming natural resources. Government is concentrated in capitals, so is the money. Most urban Africans work for a small minority of the rich, who tend to be involved in either cronyish （有裙带关系的） businesses or politics. Since African agriculture is still broadly unproductive, food is imported, consuming a portion of revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what can be done? Though African countries are poor, not all African cities are. In Lagos, foreign oil workers can pay as much as 65,000 dollars per year in rent for a modest apartment in a safe part of town. If that income were better taxed, it might provide the revenue for better infrastructure. If city leaders were more accountable to their residents, they might favour projects designed to help them more. Yet even as new roads are built, new people arrive.
